	<h2>Prologue (Point-of-View: Chett)</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Clubfoot Karl, Small Paul*, Sawwood*, Maslyn* (stewards of the Night's Watch planning to desert with Chett and Lark);</p>
<p>Dirk, Ollo Lophand (rangers who plan to desert, both currently in Craster's Keep after killing the wildling and their Lord Commander);</p>
<p>Softfoot* (a ranger planning desertion);</p>
<p>Sweet Donnel Hill (squire to Ser Mallador Locke, planned to desert; currently at Castle Black);</p>
<p>Kedge Whiteye*, Tumberjon*, Goady* (rangers who scouted the Milkwater with Thoren Smallwood, killed at the Fist of the First Men);</p>
<p>Brown Bernarr*, Grubbs*, Aethan* (rangers killed by wights at the Fist);</p>
<p>Blane* (one of Qhorin's men from the Shadow Tower; killed on the Fist of the First Men);</p>
<p>Bannen* (a tracker of the Watch, died in Craster's Keep from wounds inflicted by the wights).</p>
<p>Chett's hatred of Jon Snow and Sam Tarly for usurping his cushy position as steward to Maester Aemon has boiled over. He and Lark the Sisterman are conspiring to desert the Night's Watch, along with about a dozen other sworn brothers. They plan to kill Lord Commander Mormont and several others to prevent anyone from actively seeking them out. Thoren Smallwood and his party are the only of the three rangings to return so far, and they have seen the size of Mance Rayder's army. Thoren wishes to give battle to Mance's army, mainly because there are so few warriors in it, its composition mostly women and children. Chett and his men plan to kill in the dead of night, and flee to places of safety, leaving Thoren Smallwood and Ottyn Wythers as senior rangers. Thoren won't search for them because he wants to lead the attack, and Wythers would rather flee to the Wall and could care less about deserters. That evening, the Watch gathers before Mormont and his senior men, who announce that they will march in force against the wildling army, which is about ten days away. Late in the night, Chett awakens to find it snowing, and hopes his plans aren't ruined. As he approaches the sleeping Sam Tarly, Chett's target because he has the ravens and Chett hates him, a ranger in the distance sounds his horn. Sam awakens, and they hear the horn blow three times, something that has not happened in hundreds and thousands of years. For three soundings of a horn means the Others approach...</p>

<h2>Jaime (I)   pg 15</h2></p>
<p>Ser Jaime is being escorted to King's Landing by Brienne and his cousin Ser Cleos Frey. He was released in secrecy from Riverrun by Catelyn after swearing never again to take up arms against the Starks or Tullys, and to honor his brother's pledge to release Sansa and Arya. The oath was sworn at sword point, yet Jaime considers killing Brienne and getting away. He is still chained hand and foot. Their boat is moving down the Red Fork of the Trident, and Jaime has Ser Cleos shave his head so he will be less recognizable should they get caught. He treats Brienne with contempt, mocking the Starks after they find several tavern wenches hung by Northmen for sleeping with the Lannisters. Their trip is interrupted when Brienne spots a river galley bearing down on them. The galley is under the command of Ser Robin Ryger, sent by Ser Edmure Tully to return the Kingslayer. Brienne jumps out of the skiff and climbs a cliff face, knocking boulders down on the galley, sinking it. When she swims back to the boat, Jaime considers smashing her in the face with his oar, but instead pulls her into the boat.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (I) {XIX}    pg 27</h2></p>
<p>Catelyn has been confined to her father's rooms by Ser Desmond Grell for releasing the Kingslayer without the consent of Ser Edmure or King Robb. She is aware Ser Robin Ryger was sent to bring back Jaime, and hopes that he fails. Her father, near death, is mumbling in pain, "Tansy...forgive me...the blood...you'll have others...sweet babes, and trueborn..." Cat deduces that her father had had aborted a child Lysa carried before marrying. She realizes that Jon Arryn took a soiled bride, thinking, "Lysa was the price Jon Arryn had to pay for the swords of House Tully." She does not know who the father might have been. Later, Edmure returns to Riverrun, informing Cat that he has sent ravens with the message that the Kingslayer escaped. Cat despairs because should Jaime be captured, her plan for a secret exchange of hostages will never work.</p>

<h2>Arya (I) {XVI}   pg 35</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Iggo (Dothraki horselord, member of the Bloody Mummers). </p>
<p>            Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are using the map she stole from Roose Bolton to find the Trident. She plans to follow the Red Fork to Riverrun, but they seem to be lost. Fearing pursuit, they ride for long hours and exhaust themselves. Arya falls asleep and dreams through the eyes of a wolf. In the dream, she and her pack ravage four members of the Bloody Mummers, killing three and tearing off Iggo's arm. Was the dream real?</p>

<h2>Tyrion (I) {XXV}   pg 43</h2></p>
<p>Tyrion, recovering from his wounds, learns from Ser Bronn that Ser Addam Marbrand was named Commander of the City Watch since Lord Jacelyn was killed by his own men during the Battle of the Blackwater. He finds that much has changed in King's Landing under his father's rule. He also realizes that his father has seen to it that Tyrion received little of the credit for saving the city. He asks Bronn to learn more about Ser Mandon Moore, trying to discover if his sister sent the Kingsguard to kill him. Cersei has returned Tommen to the city, and the Kettleblacks, now all knights, are no longer working for Tyrion. His cousin Tyrek still has not been found, and is feared dead. Tyrion forces himself to dress and visit his father, despite his near captivity in Maegor's Holdfast by his sister. Lord Tywin reveals that some battles are won by quills and ravens, and is in the process of composing letters. The Hand tells his son that Ser Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are marching on Duskendale, but he has sent Lord Randyll Tarly and Ser Gregor to deal with them. Tyrion seeks a little gratitude from his father, but Lord Tywin tells him, "Mummers and monkeys require applause." Tyrion states that he wants Casterly Rock, as he is heir by rights since Jaime is a sworn brother of the Kingsguard. Tywin will never let Tyrion have the Lannisters' ancestral seat, however, and warns him that he will hang the next whore Tyrion takes to bed.</p>

<h2>Davos (I) {IV}   pg 54</h2></p>
<p>            Davos has washed up on the shore of a small island in the Blackwater Bay. He remembers swimming beneath the chain boom, and then getting caught by the current and gulping seawater. But somehow, he is alive, and believes the Seven still have some use for him. Despairing over the loss of four of his sons in the sea battle, he contemplates dying on the island, but decides instead to live. A Lyseni ship rescues him, one of Salladhor Saan's fleet.</p>

<h2>Sansa (I) {XV}   pg 61</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lady Olenna Tyrell (the Queen of Thorns, of House Redwyne, mother of Lord Mace Tyrell, Lady Mina Redwyne, and Lady Janna Fossoway, grandmother of Willas, Ser Garlan, Ser Loras, Queen Margaery, Ser Hobber and Ser Horas Redwyne; widowed wife of Lord Luthor Tyrell; good-sister of Garth the Gross, Ser Moryn, and Maester Gormon);</p>
<p>Ser Kennos of Kayce (a knight sworn to Casterly Rock, specifically Lord Terrence Kenning [Lord of Kayce]; owner of the Horn of Herrock [?]);</p>
<p>Erryk and Arryk (called Left and Right, twin guardsman of the Queen of Thorns);</p>
<p>Lady Alerie Tyrell (of House Hightower, wife of Lord Mace, mother of Willas, Ser Garlan, Ser Loras and Margaery; sister or half-sister of Ser Baelor Hightower, Malora, Ser Garth, Lynesse [Ser Jorah Mormont's ex-wife], and Ser Gunthor, among others; daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower, good-daughter of Lady Olenna Tyrell);</p>
<p>Elinor Tyrell (cousin and companion of Margaery, betrothed to Alyn Ambrose, great-granddaughter of Ser Moryn Tyrell; great-niece of Lazy Leo);</p>
<p>Megga Tyrell (cousin of Queen Margaery and her brothers, granddaughter of Lord Mace Tyrell's late cousin Ser Quentin);</p>
<p>Alla Tyrell (cousin and companion of Queen Margaery, granddaughter of Lord Mace's late cousin Ser Victor);</p>
<p>Lady Janna Fossoway (of House Tyrell, sister of Lord Mace Tyrell, wife of Ser Jon Fossoway, daughter of the Queen of Thorns);</p>
<p>Lady Leonette Tyrell (of House Fossoway, wife of Ser Garlan the Gallant);</p>
<p>Septa Nysterica (a sister of the Faith, tutor to Margaery and her cousins);</p>

<p>Lady Alysanne Bulwer (a young girl; distant cousin of the Tyrells, granddaughter of the late Ser Victor, first cousin of Alla Tyrell);</p>
<p>Meredyth Crane (called Merry, a lady from house Crane of Red Lake; one of Queen Margaery's ladies-in-waiting);</p>
<p>Lady Taena Merryweather (of Myr, wife of Lord Orton Merryweather, met her husband while he was in exile with his grandfather Lord Owen [one of King Aerys II's Hands], companion of Margaery, later a confidant [or pretending to be] of Cersei Lannister);</p>
<p>Butterbumps (a fat fool and jester from Highgarden).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Willas Tyrell (eldest son of Lord Mace and Lady Alerie, heir to Highgarden, brother of Ser Garlan, Ser Loras and Margaery, crippled by the Red Viper during a tourney);</p>
<p>Lord Luthor Tyrell* (former Lord of Highgarden, father of Lord Mace Tyrell, husband of Lady Olenna, died in a fall off a cliff).</p>
<p>Legends: Garth Greenhand (legendary Gardener king of the First Men; House Tyrell claims descent from him through the female line).</p>
<p>Sansa is invited to dinner by Margaery and her grandmother, the Lady Olenna. She is escorted to the party by Ser Loras, and unknowingly upsets him by talking of Renly's death. The party is held in the Maidenvault, where King Baelor the Blessed confined his sisters so they would not tempt him, as he had sworn a vow of celibacy. She is introduced to all of Margaery's cousins and companions, but it is the Queen of Thorns who takes the most interest in Sansa. Lady Olenna reveals that the Baratheons have Targaryen blood, and that the Tyrell claim to Highgarden has always been shaky since several other houses in the Reach can claim descent from Garth Greenhand as well. The old woman makes it known that her son is an oaf for making this alliance with the Lannisters, and she wishes to learn from Sansa the truth of what Joffrey is. Sansa fears that Varys is listening, but Lady Olenna commands Butterbumps to sing at the top of his voice. Sansa reveals the truth about Joff to the Queen of Thorns and Margaery, telling them that the King is a monster and that she fears for Margaery. Lady Olenna assures Sansa that the wedding will still go on, as Lord Mace is determined that his daughter wed King Joffrey. The Queen of Thorns offers Sansa a proposal to visit Highgarden after the wedding, and wishes Sansa to marry her grandson Willas.</p>

<h2>Jon (I) {XVIII}   pg 74</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mance Rayder (King-beyond-the-Wall, self-styled king of the wildlings, once a sworn brother of the Night's Watch from the Shadow Tower, widowed husband of Dalla, father of an infant son currently with Gilly in Oldtown);</p>
<p>Tormund Giantsbane (Tormund Thunderfist, Husband of Bears, the Mead-king of Ruddy Hall, Tall-Talker, Horn-blower, Breaker of Ice, Speaker to Gods, Father of Hosts, a wildling warchief);</p>
<p>Styr* (the Magnar of Thenn, worshiped as a god by his people; killed at Castle Black by the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>The Weeper* (a wildling leader, killed in the gorges west of the Shadow Tower by the Night's Watch under Bowen Marsh);</p>
<p>Harma the Dogshead* (a wildling warrior-woman, commands the van of Mance's army; slain by King Stannis' knights);</p>
<p>Jarl* (a wildling leader; fell attempting to climb the Wall);</p>
<p>Dalla* (a wildling queen as she delivered Mance's child; died in childbirth);</p>
<p>Val (Dalla's sister, Jarl's lover, referred to by Stannis' men as the 'wildling princess');</p>
<p>Lenyl, Longspear Ryk (members of Rattleshirt's band).</p>
<p>Jon is brought before Mance Rayder, since Rattleshirt doesn't trust him. In the King's tent, Jon mistakes Styr for Mance Rayder. But it is the gray-haired man playing the lute who is the King-beyond-the-Wall. Rattleshirt reveals his misgivings about Jon to the king, but Mance wishes to speak with Jon alone. Mance indicates that he has seen Jon twice before, once when he was still a black brother and Jon just a boy, and again during King Robert's visit to Winterfell! Mance had disguised himself as a singer in order to see King Robert and get the measure of Benjen Stark, who was a bane to the wildlings. Testing Jon, he asks why he deserted the Night's Watch, but Jon asks him to go first. The king explains that he had been wounded and treated by a wildling woman, and then came to realize the restriction he felt wearing the black cloak of the Night's Watch. Jon, knowing now that Mance was at Winterfell, asks, "And did you see where I was seated Mance? Did you see where they put the bastard?" The king then accepts Jon as member of the free folk.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (I) {XVI}   pg 86</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Captain Groleo (captain of Balerion, in the hire of Magister Illyrio).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Queen Rhaella Targaryen* (wife and sister of King Aerys II, daughter of King Jaehaerys II, granddaughter of King Aegon V, mother of Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys, died giving birth to Dany on Dragonstone; daughter of King Jaehaerys II);</p>
<p>Ser Myles Mooton* (squire to Prince Rhaegar and later knighted, slain by Robert Baratheon at the Battle of the Bells; brother of Lord William Mooton);</p>
<p>Richard Lonmouth* (squire to Prince Rhaegar, later knighted, unknown if dead).</p>
<p>Legends: Khal Temmo (khal of the Dothraki defeated by the Three Thousand of Qohor).</p>
<p>Illyrio's three ships are sailing for Pentos, and Dany is watching her dragons fly over the ocean. Arstan tells her that Balerion was 200 years old when he died during the reign of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator. Arstan then speaks of Rhaegar, how he had been bookish as a child, always reading. Then one day he had read something in a scroll that made him want to be a warrior, and he began training fiercely. Arstan admits Rhaegar was a great warrior, but he had won no battles. Later, Jorah tells her that Arstan is more than he seems, and warns her not to trust him. The knight advises her to sail for Astapor and buy Unsullied, the best trained fighting force in the world. He tells the tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor, where a small army of Unsullied defeated a huge khalasar trying to pillage Qohor. The Unsullied are eunuch slaves trained to obey orders absolutely, and they feel no pain. Dany agrees that she will force Captain Groleo and Strong Belwas to change course. Ser Jorah then grabs her by the waist and kisses her. Dany tells him he should not have done so, but Jorah talks of her vision in the House of the Undying, and how the dragon having three heads may mean that she should take two husbands.</p>

<h2>Bran (I) {XV}  pg 100</h2></p>
<p>            Bran now has the ability to open his third eye at will, and become Summer. Jojen again warns him not to spend too much time as Summer, neglecting his body and forgetting what he should do when in contact with his direwolf. They have been traveling north; staying away from civilization for fear that Bran might be seen. The world is better off believing he is dead, especially agents of the ironmen or the Bastard of Bolton. Jojen insists they make for the Wall so that Bran can find the three-eyed crow, because Jojen can teach him no more.</p>

<h2>Davos (II) {V}  pg 109</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Edric Storm (highborn bastard son of Robert Baratheon and Lady Delena Florent [daughter of Ser Colin Florent, niece of Lord Alester Florent, cousin of Queen Selyse Baratheon], recognized by King Robert, former ward of Ser Cortnay Penrose, later ward of King Stannis, later still rescued from Dragonstone by Ser Davos);</p>
<p>Captain Khorane Sathmantes (Lyseni captain under Salladhor Saan);</p>
<p>Meizo Mahr (a eunuch in the employ of Salladhor Saan).</p>
<p>Davos learns that his son Devan is alive, and that mainly only the Florents remain to King Stannis. Many of his other bannermen who were captured during the Battle bent the knee to King Joffrey. He also learns that Lord Guncer Sunglass was sacrificied to the fire by Melisandre as an offering to R'hllor. Salladhor tells Davos that Lord Alester is now Hand of the King, but Stannis remains in the Stone Drum and sees no one but Melisandre. Davos plans to kill the Red Woman, and reveals as much to Salla. When put ashore, he meets Shireen and Edric Storm. The boy greatly resembles Robert and Renly, and he reveres his father. Edric says that his uncle Stannis should never have chopped off Davos' fingers, but the Onion Knight knows that Robert was a different man than Stannis. Before Edric can talk further, Ser Axell arrives and takes Davos into custody for plotting to kill Melisandre.</p>

<h2>Jaime (II)   pg 120</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Sharna (innkeeper and midwife at the Inn of the Kneeling Man; sympathetic to the cause of the brotherhood without banners);</p>
<p>Husband (Sharna's husband);</p>
<p>Boy (a boy working for Sharna).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Roland Crakehall (Lord of Crakehall, father of Ser Tybolt, Ser Lyle [Strongboar], and Ser Merlon, brother of the late Ser Burton);</p>
<p>Lord Rossart* (former Pyromancer, last of Mad King Aerys' Hands, slain by Ser Jaime Lannister);</p>
<p>Ser Sumner Crakehall* (former Lord of Crakehall, Jaime squired for him during the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood);</p>
<p>Ser Harlan Grandison* (Kingsguard who died in his sleep during the reign of Aerys II, replaced by Ser Jaime).</p>
<p>Jaime, Brienne and Ser Cleos stop at the Inn of the Kneeling Man to eat. The innkeep mentions the Lightning Lord, and we learn that Lord Beric and Thoros are still together raiding in the riverlands. The innkeep recommends they abandon their skiff and ride for King's Landing. Brienne buys the inn's horses for three gold and their skiff, getting robbed blind according to Jaime. The husband of the innkeeper recommends they follow a specific path to avoid outlaws, and they ride off. Jaime is impressed that Brienne takes the opposite path, realizing they might have been set up. That night, Jaime reminisces of how he became a Kingsguard. His sister was brought to court by Lord Tywin, who was Hand at the time. He hoped to wed her to Prince Viserys. Jaime was squiring for Ser Sumner Crakehall, and was knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne during the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood. Cersei later told him that their father meant to wed him to Lysa Arryn, and she told him that if he took the white cloak, they could be together in King's Landing. They did it behind their father's back, and Lord Tywin could not object to King Aerys' wishes. Tywin then resigned as Hand and took Cersei back to Casterly Rock, unknowingly ruining their plan, for Jaime was now stuck in King's Landing as a sworn brother of the Kingsguard.</p>
<p>Years later, when Aerys made the mistake of admitting Lord Tywin's army, the Mad King called for the former Hand's head. Alone in the throne room, Aerys had one final plan, but Jaime arrived in his golden armor, the blood of Lord Rossart on his blade, and killed the King. Jaime had hoped to slip out unnoticed, but his father's men entered the throne room, and they thought Jaime meant to give the throne to his father, but Jaime told them he didn't care who was proclaimed king. He was waiting on the iron throne to see who would come to claim the kingdom, but it was Eddard Stark who found him there. You had no right to judge me, Stark. And the taint of being found in the throne room with the blood of the king he had sworn to protect on his hands would never go away. If only his father's men hadn't found him standing over Aerys' body...</p>

<h2>Tyrion (II) {XXVI}   pg 132</h2></p>
<p>Legends: Grand Maester Gerardys (fed to King Aegon II's dragon for displeasing the king during the Dance of the Dragons).
	Tyrion is waiting in Varys' room when the eunuch walks in. The Spider reveals that the Hand means to restore Pycelle as Grand Maester, since the archmaesters of the Citadel claimed that “only the conclave can unmake a Grand Maester”. When the conclave meant to send Maester Gormon, Lord Tywin acted at once, not wishing another Tyrell on the small council. Tyrion is surprised to learn that Varys has whisperers even in the Citadel, where the conclave always met in secrecy. He finds out that Ser Boros Blount has been restored to the Kingsguard, and that Ser Mandon Moore had been brought to King's Landing by Lord Jon Arryn. Tyrion asks Varys to bring Shae to the eunuch's chambers so that no one will notice their meeting. He realizes that he cannot trust Varys any further, but hopes to use him this one last time. When he meets Shae, he means to send her away to protect her from his father, but Tyrion once again cannot bear to part with her. He also knows he must deal with the singer Symon if he means to keep Shae in King's Landing.</p>

<h2>Arya (II) {XVII}   pg 142</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lem Lemoncloak (a former soldier turned outlaw, fighter in the brotherhood without banners, now a staunch supporter of Lady Stoneheart);</p>
<p>Tom of Sevenstreams (Tom Sevenstrings, Tom o' Sevens, a singer and member of the Lightning Lord's outlaw brotherhood; currently in Riverrun "entertaining" Lord Emmon Frey and Lady Genna of house Lannister).</p>
<p>Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are picking vegetables when they hear riders approaching. Despite hiding, they are discovered and held at arrow point. The three riders tell them that they are king's men, meaning King Robert. They are taken to the Inn of the Kneeling Man, and fed by Sharna. When Tom Sevenstrings tells Husband he shouldn't have sold the horses, the man tells Tom they were supposed to get them back. Arya realizes the men are outlaws, and working with the people at the inn. Tom offers her a parchment owing her three gold if she sells them her horses. When they hear more riders approaching, Arya reacts, breaking Lem's nose with an ale cup. She gets held down before she can escape, and watches the riders enter. One of them is Harwin, her father's man and Hullen's son. When Arya calls out to him, he falls to one knee before her, and informs the others that she is Arya Stark, the Hand's daughter.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (II) {XX}   pg 155</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lady Sybell Westerling (of House Spicer, wife of Lord Gawen Westerling, mother of Ser Reynald, Queen Jeyne, Elenya, and Rollam, sister of Ser Rolph Spicer; possibly the granddaughter of Maggy the Frog);</p>
<p>Jeyne Westerling (wife and Queen of Robb Stark, daughter of Lord Gawen and Lady Sybell Westerling, sister of Ser Reynald, Elenya, and Rollam; remains loyal to her deceased husband);</p>
<p>Ser Rolph Spicer (brother of Lady Sybell, once castellan at the Crag, later named Lord of Castamere);</p>
<p>Ser Raynald Westerling* (heir to the Crag, Jeyne's older brother; shot full of arrows during the Red Wedding after setting Grey Wind loose on the Freys);</p>
<p>Elenya Westerling (younger sister of Queen Jeyne);</p>
<p>Rollam Westerling (younger brother of Jeyne, new squire of Robb Stark; now heir to the Crag).</p>
<p>Legends: Queen Jeyne Targaryen (of House Westerling, wife of King Maegor the Cruel).</p>
<p>Cat hears Robb's return from the west, and recalls that when Edmure returned, dozens of men left after trampling Robb's banner, all of them Freys. She is brought before her son, and is confronted by Lord Rickard Karstark for her release of the Kingslayer. Robb silences Karstark who leaves the room in a fury. In privacy, the king introduces her to his new bride and her family. Robb had taken a wound storming the Crag, and Jeyne had nursed him back to health. Cat is concerned about how Lord Tywin will take this betrayal, as the Westerlings are bannermen to Casterly Rock. She is also upset that Grey Wind is not with her son, because Jeyne is afraid of the wolf, and the beast growls whenever Ser Rolph Spicer is near. Cat convinces him to send Ser Rolph off on some errand, for Grey Wind should always be near him. She considers what it may take to appease Lord Walder after this slight. The loss of the Freys is strongly felt by Robb, and there was nothing that could be done when Ser Ryman and Black Walder led their men back to the Twins. The Blackfish then tears into Edmure for engaging Lord Tywin. Ser Brynden's plan was for Riverrun to stay put, and lure Tywin into the west, where Robb's mounted army could run them ragged along the mountains, and fall on them from a fortified position. Edmure ruined their whole plan, and admits that he must make amends. Robb plans to return to the North, but first he must win back the Freys...</p>

<h2>Jon (II) {XIX}    pg 166</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg* (Mag the Mighty, king of the giants; slain by Donal Noye at the gate to Castle Black);</p>
<p>Varamyr (called Sixskins, a warg of the wildlings);</p>
<p>Toregg, Dormund (sons of Tormund Giantsbane).</p>
<p>Jon is observing Mance's host, taking note of all the giants and mammoths that make up the army. Tormund is telling Jon some tall tales about himself, when the eagle that was once Orell rakes Jon's face. Rattleshirt has arrived to bring Jon before Mance, this time at the Fist of the First Men. The king confronts Jon about how many men were at the Fist, and who led. Jon, seeing how many of the Watch died here and realizing Mance may kill him for lying, tells the truth. Still, Mance and his men would have killed Jon for his lies, but Ygritte saves him by telling them that they are lovers. The wildlings respect any man who steals his woman, and Rayder informs Jon that he will be leaving with Styr and Jarl on the morrow to climb the Wall. That night, Jon and Ygritte share a bed together.</p>

<h2>Sansa (II) {XVI}   pg 181</h2></p>
<p>            Sansa is being fitted for a new gown provided by Queen Cersei. Margaery informs Sansa that she does not fear Joff, because her father had only conceded her hand in marriage with the provision that Ser Loras was named to the Kingsguard. Her brother would protect her from Joff. When Sansa told Dontos about the Queen of Thorn's plan to marry her to Willas, the drunk warns her that the Tyrells wish to wed her for her claim to Winterfell, stating, "These Tyrells are only Lannisters with flowers." Dontos tells her that they will escape, as promised, on Joff's wedding day.</p>

<h2>Arya (III) {XVIII}   pg 187</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Jack-be-Lucky (a one-eyed outlaw, fighter in Lord Beric's brotherhood);</p>
<p>Greenbeard (a Tyroshi sellsword, real name Pello, a sergeant in Lord Beric's company).</p>
<p>Hot Pie has decided to stay with Sharna as a baker at the inn. The others departed for Riverrun, or so Tom told Arya. Harwin tells Arya the tale of how they first rode out in search of Ser Gregor, and about all the men they lost when Gregor's men fell on them. Most of the 120 men from the original group were dead, including Lothar Mallery and Ser Gladden Wylde. It was all a trap, Lord Tywin had planned for Lord Eddard himself to ride out and deal with Gregor, but Jaime didn't know of the plan when he attacked Ned in the streets of King's Landing. Since the Hand's leg was broken, he had to send others out, but Lord Beric and the survivors learned a sharp lesson when they had sprung the trap. Dondarrion should have died, having been run through with a lance, but Thoros saved him. And that was when they became outlaws, dead King Robert's men but hunted by the new Hand Lord Tywin. They harried the foraging parties and attacked the baggage trains of Tywin's army, and their brotherhood began to grow as many flocked to their cause, mostly commoners uprooted by the war. Later, they meet up with Greenbeard and learn that Jaime Lannister had escaped from Riverrun. When Arya discovers that they mean to bring her before Lord Beric rather than take her to Riverrun, she tries to ride off, but Harwin catches her. Her father's man is now a member of the brotherhood without banners, and answers only to Beric and Thoros' Lord of Light, the god R'hllor.</p>

<h2>Samwell (I)   pg 195</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Black Bernarr* (ranger of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>            Sam and the few survivors from the Fist are running south in the middle of night with a heavy snow falling. They are ringed by men with torches to keep the wights away, but Sam is beginning to lag and is near exhaustion. He eventually falls in the snow, and cannot get back on his feet. He recalls the horror that occurred at the Fist, when the wights fell on the Night's Watch. Mormont had commanded him to send ravens with warning, and Sam kept sending them with updates, but when it came time to send a raven with word that their end was near, Sam had already let the birds escape. The Watch had held the Fist at first, using fire arrows to hold back the wights. But the dead were relentless and eventually overpowered the Watch, men dying by the score. Mormont had the survivors mount up and form a wedge, slashing past the wights and down off the Fist into the forest. Now they were running for the Wall, pursued by the wights and perhaps the Others. Grenn tries to get Sam to his feet, but the fat steward is too tired, and finally Small Paul arrives and carries Sam. But the three of them have fallen far behind the survivors with their torches, and the cold sets in. Upon an undead horse, an Other appears from the swirling snow. The being kills Small Paul with its ice sword, but Sam stabs the Other with the dragonglass dagger that Jon had given him. The dagger causes the Other to melt away, body and armor, before Sam and Grenn's eyes! Grenn retrieves the burning hot obsidian dagger, and they once again run off to try and catch the other survivors.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (III) {XXVII}   pg 209</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Reyne* (the Red Lion, once Lord of Castamere, his entire line killed off by Lord Tywin for disloyalty to his father; Castamere is ruins now and the Reynes are no more, although Ser Rolph Spicer was recently raised to Lord of Castamere);</p>
<p>Lady Ellyn Tarbeck* (scheming Lady of Tarbeck Hall, the Tarbecks were also wiped out by Lord Tywin);</p>
<p>Lord Farman* (prior Lord of Faircastle, his disobedience to Lord Tywin was silenced when a singer played "The Rains of Castamere" in his hall).</p>
<p>The council meets to discuss the progress of the war, and Tyrion learns that Ser Lancel is still near death. Lord Randyll Tarly defeated the northmen attacking Duskendale, with Ser Helman Tallhart reported dead, and Robett Glover fleeing west and chased by Gregor Clegane. Tywin informs them that Ser Daven Lannister is rounding up a new army and will join with men from the Golden Tooth, and then march on Riverrun when Robb Stark returns north. They all agree that Robb will march for Moat Cailin, for he is a king without a kingdom. Ser Kevan reveals that King Balon Greyjoy has sent letters with terms of alliance. Greyjoy wants the North, but Lord Tywin says they will not treat with Balon while other options may present themselves. Littlefinger agrees to go to the Eyrie to marry Lysa Arryn, and once he is consort, deliver the Vale of Arryn into Tywin's hands. Since Littlefinger will be leaving within a day, Tyrion is named master of coins. Pycelle informs them that 300 Dornishmen ride for King's Landing in response to Tyrion's negotiations, despite the hatred between Dorne and Highgarden that has gone on for hundreds of years. Mace Tyrell does not like the idea of Dornishmen riding across the Reach, and Tyrion considers how the Lord of Highgarden prides himself on his victory over Robert Baratheon at Ashford, even though Lord Tarly's van had won that battle. Mace Tyrell laid siege to Storm's End for a year without result, and although he talked like a general, he had never won a decisive battle himself.</p>
<p>Ser Garlan Tyrell has been named Lord of Brightwater Keep since Lord Alester Florent is a traitor. Varys brings word of a three-headed dragon being born in Qarth, and that the Night's Watch is begging for help against a wilding army. Lord Tywin does not want to hear about rumors, and adjourns the meeting, asking Tyrion, Cersei and Ser Kevan to stay. Tyrion warns them not to trust Littlefinger with this quest to the Vale, but Tywin is resolute, telling Tyrion that just the other day Baelish informed them of a plot by the Tyrells to bring Sansa to Highgarden and marry her to Willas. The Hand is aware that should Mace Tyrell ask leave to bring Sansa to Highgarden, they must consent or else offend the Tyrells. Lord Tywin wishes to circumvent this problem by offering Cersei's hand in marriage to Willas, despite the Queen's adamant refusal. But their father has the final say, and Cersei storms out of the room in a fury. Tywin then tells Tyrion that he will wed Sansa Stark, further solidifying the Lannisters' position, because should Robb die and Sansa and Tyrion have a son, the child will become Lord of Winterfell. Tyrion also learns that Robb has broken his pledge with the Freys and married Jeyne Westerling. Ser Kevan reveals that Lord Westerling's wife is a Spicer, a house of extremely low birth having descended from traders. Tyrion is confused by the lack of fury in his father's eyes at this betrayal by the Westerlings, a house sworn to Casterly Rock. Lord Tywin states, "Jeyne Westerling is her mother's daughter, and Robb Stark is his father's son." Jeyne's mother had wed a man of much higher birth than herself, and Robb married Jeyne after deflowering her because he was as honorable as his father.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (III) {XXI}   pg 225</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Long Lew (guardsman at Riverrun).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Tion Frey* (a squire, son of Genna Lannister and Ser Emmon Frey, younger brother of Ser Cleos, cousin of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion; murdered by men sworn to Lord Karstark);</p>
<p>Willem Lannister* (a squire, son of Ser Kevan Lannister, younger brother of Ser Lancel, cousin of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion; murdered by command of Lord Rickard Karstark).</p>
<p>Legends: Karlon Stark (a younger son of an ancient Stark king, built Karl's Hold which later became known as Karhold, and the Karhold Starks became known as the Karstarks).</p>
<p>The bodies of Willem Lannister and Tion Frey are brought before Robb Stark, along with Lord Rickard Karstark and a few of his men who had butchered the two captives. The Greatjon has Lord Karstark in chains. Lord Rickard wanted vengeance for the loss of his two sons, but Cat had released the Kingslayer. Robb sentences him to death, knowing that he must hold the sword since both the Starks and Karstarks are descended from the First Men. The Karstark men had already departed Riverrun to seek out and kill Ser Jaime Lannister, also offering gold and the hand of Lord Rickard's daughter in marriage to anyone who could turn the Kingslayer over to them. Edmure urges Robb to hold Lord Karstark hostage and not to let word get out to the Freys or Lannisters about the two squires' deaths. But Robb has no choice but to kill the man whose two sons died defending his life. Robb carries out the sentence in the godswood. That night, Jeyne comes to Cat for advice in comforting Robb, and the young woman promises that she will soon bear Robb's son if the gods answer her prayers.</p>

<h2>Jaime (III)   pg 235</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Urswyck (the Faithful, a sergeant of the Bloody Mummers);</p>
<p>Timeon* (a Dornishman, member of the Mummers; slain by Lady Brienne);</p>
<p>Fat Zollo (a Dothraki, member of the Mummers).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lady Joanna Lannister* (wife and cousin of Lord Tywin, sister of Ser Stafford, mother of Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion, died giving birth to Tyrion).</p>
<p>Jaime has decided that he will return Sansa, and Arya should he find her, to their mother as he promised. The idea of honoring his word when everyone expected him to betray it amused him. As they are traveling for Duskendale, archers attack them from behind a wall. Ser Cleos Frey is killed, but Brienne and Jaime chase off the archers. Jaime grabs his cousin's sword and attacks Brienne. The two fight for a long while, Jaime shocked by what a great swordfighter Brienne is. The woman eventually overpowers him, and holds his head under water in a stream until he yields. But they are surrounded by Bloody Mummers, and Jaime learns that they no longer work for his father, but for Roose Bolton. The Mummers plan to bring Jaime before Lord Vargo. Later, Jaime rescues Brienne from being raped by telling Urswyck that her father is the Lord of Sapphire Isle, a lie to make them think she is worth a lot in ransom. Soon after, they are brought before the Goat, and Vargo has Fat Zollo chop off Jaime's sword hand as a message to Lord Tywin.</p>

<h2>Arya (IV) {XIX}   pg 246</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Lymond Lychester (an old senile knight);</p>
<p>Maester Roone (maester attending Lord Lychester, sympathizer of the Lightning Lord's cause);</p>
<p>The Lady of the Leaves (a woman living in a small tree village, sympathetic to the outlaws);</p>
<p>The Ghost of High Heart (a very old dwarf woman, some say she is a ghost of the children of the forest, possesses the greensight; possibly the mother of Jenny of Oldstones who was Prince Duncan the Small's lover);</p>
<p>Lady Ravella Smallwood (of House Swann, Lady of Acorn Hall, holding Acorn Hall for her husband Lord Theomar Smallwood, sympathizer of the outlaws).</p>
<p>Legends: Erreg the Kinslayer (Andal king who cut down the weirwoods at High Heart).</p>
<p>The outlaws first visit Lord Lychester and then the Lady of the Leaves in search of word on Lord Beric's whereabouts. But none have seen him, only hearing rumors that he was dead- hung once, killed by Vargo Hoat, Ser Amory Lorch and twice by Ser Gregor. The same rumors Arya had been hearing at Harrenhal. But Lem and Tom know that Beric is still alive. The outlaws plan to ransom Arya at Riverrun after they meet up with Beric and Thoros. They arrive at High Heart, an ancient hill sacred to the children of the forest. Thirty-one mighty weirwoods had stood at the top of the hill, but only their stumps remained from after the Andals chopped them down. Yet Arya could still feel the power of the place. The old dwarf woman speaks in private to Lem, Tom and Greenbeard, but Arya overhears the conversation. The woman has dreams while sleeping among the weirwood stumps, and tells them she dreamt of "a shadow with a burning heart killing a golden stag"; of "a man without a face, waiting on a swaying bridge, on his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from its wings"; and of "a raging river and a woman that was a fish...dead with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, I woke from terror." At Acorn Hall, Lady Smallwood informs them that Thoros had been through recently, and that Karstark men were searching for the Kingslayer. Arya and Gendry go off to the smithy, and the former apprentice explains that Thoros was a charlatan, using regular swords with wildfire to make his flaming sword.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (II) {XVII}    pg 257</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Kraznys mo Nakloz* (master slaver in Astapor; killed by Dany's dragon Drogon).</p>
<p>Dany and one of the master slavers in Astapor are discussing the purchase of Unsullied through a translator. Dany is pretending not to know High Valyrian speech, but she understands everything the slaver is saying to the translator. Kraznys demonstrates the loyalty of the Unsullied, how the eunuchs follow every command given them and feel hardly any pain. Both Dany and Arstan are horrified by the conditions the Unsullied live under, and the brutality of their training. The slaver indicates he has 8,000 Unsullied currently for sale. Dany informs him she will spend the night considering an offer. Arstan is against the use of slaves, when sellswords can be bought in the Free Cities. Ser Jorah advises that the Unsullied are too useful to pass up, but how could they afford more than a few hundred, having little gold and just the ships and their cargo...</p>

<h2>Bran (II) {XVI}   pg 274</h2></p>
<p>Traveling north to the Wall, Bran and his companions meet a Liddle in the hills. The man indicates that the Bastard of Bolton is offering gold for wolfskins and for word on the walking dead (Ramsay knows Bran and Rickon are still alive, of course). Later, Meera tells a story of a hero who might have been a crannogman, during the year of the false spring. This crannogman had left Greywater Watch and visited the Green Men on the Isle of Faces. Returning home, he stopped at Harrenhal for the great tourney. Three squires accosted him and mocked him for his short stature, knocking him to the ground until he was rescued by a she-wolf. The story names no names, but from their references, we know who they are. </p>
<p>The story tells of Jaime Lannister being named to the Kingsguard, despite his father's absence (Lord Tywin had recently resigned as Hand). The she-wolf is Lyanna, and Brandon, Eddard and Benjen were all at the tourney as well. Brandon had asked Ashara Dayne, one of Princess Elia's ladies-in-waiting, to dance with his shy brother Eddard. Benjen offered the crannogman some armor so that he could take his vengeance on the squires during the tourney, but the little man turned him down. The crannogman prayed to the old gods, and the next day at the tourney, a mystery knight called the Knight of the Laughing Tree defeated the knights whose squires had wronged the crannogman. Instead of collecting a ransom from the three defeated knights, the mystery knight asked them to teach their squires honor. The Knight of the Laughing Tree disappeared before he could be unmasked, despite the fury of King Aerys. The tourney was won by Prince Rhaegar, but Meera ends the story saying that what happened next was a sadder tale that deserved its own telling. Bran had never heard this story before, and both Reeds are surprised that Lord Eddard had never related it to him before.</p>

<h2>Davos (III) {VI}   pg 285</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lamprey, Porridge (jailers in the dungeons of Dragonstone).</p>
<p>Davos, imprisoned beneath Dragonstone, is visited by Melisandre. The Red Woman tells Davos that her purpose is to keep darkness at bay. When Davos asks about the shadow she had birthed, she tells him that Stannis is too weak, and should she draw more life-energy from him he would die. Melisandre tells Davos that there are only two gods, R'hllor and the Great Other, whose name cannot be spoken. They are opposites, white and black, good and evil, fire and ice. The Other is the god of Darkness, the Soul of Ice and his war with R'hllor is everywhere and everlasting. Melisandre tells him that the Other's servants often hide in plain view, but the priests of R'hllor can see through falsehoods. Melisandre speaks of a prophecy, which portends that Azor Ahai will be born again in the light of R'hllor, and she is convinced that Stannis is the embodiment of this prophecy: "When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone." Melisandre departs, telling him that he has served R'hllor once and will do so again.</p>
<p>Later, Ser Axell brings his brother Lord Alester, Stannis' Hand, and tosses him into the cell with Davos. Lord Florent is a defeated man, and he tells Davos that his nephew Ser Imry died with the fleet, and that most of Stannis' bannermen were captured at the Battle and bent the knee to Joffrey. He was now condemned as a traitor for writing a letter he planned to send to Lord Tywin, offering peace, wherein Stannis would swear fealty to Joffrey but would remain Lord of Dragonstone and Storm's End, and that the Florents would get Brightwater Keep back. In addition, he offered Shireen's hand in marriage to Tommen. Alester rants about Melisandre's talk of a stone dragon, "madness, sheer madness. Did we learn nothing from Aerion Brightfire, from the nine mages, from the alchemists? Did we learn nothing from Summerhall? No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons." Davos scorns Lord Alester's alliance offer, stating that Stannis would rather die a king than bend his knee, and that he would never consent to wed his daughter to Tommen, a child born of incest.</p>

<h2>Jon (III) {XX}   pg 294</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Grigg the Goat* (wildling in Jarl's party).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Qorgyle* (Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, predecessor to Lord Mormont).</p>
<p>Legends: Arson Iceaxe (legendary wildling who tried to dig through the Wall).</p>
<p>The night before the planned attempt to scale the Wall, Jon tells Ghost that he cannot come with him, and that they will meet again at Castle Black. The Magnar forces Jon to tell him more about the patrols the Night's Watch use along the Wall. Jarl and Styr plan to climb the Wall between Stonedoor and Greyguard, where a hill rests against the Wall, making for a shorter climb. Later, Jon and Ygritte spend time in a cavern which supposedly leads from the Haunted Forest all the way beneath the Wall and beyond, but no one since Gendel and Gorne, the legendary wildling twin kings, knows the way. Ygritte asks Jon to stay with her and hide in this cavern forever.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (III) {XVIII}    pg 304</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Missandei (a slave girl from Naath, freed by Dany);</p>
<p>Grazdan mo Ullhor* (an old Ghiscari master slaver in Astapor; slain by Rakharo when Dany frees the slaves of Astapor).</p>
<p>Legends: Grazdan the Great (founded the Empire of Ghis in the dawn of days, before the Valyrians were even civilized).</p>
<p>Dany tells the slavers that she wants all eight thousand Unsullied, plus all the slave boys in training, whether they've been cut yet or not. In order to pay the slave masters, Dany offers all three of her ships as well as Drogon, for the price of a dragon is incalculable. Dany frees Missandei and takes her into her service, revealing that she can speak High Valyrian. We learn that valar morghulis means ‘all men must die'. That night, Quaithe appears to Dany, seemingly in a dream, telling her again, "To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow." When the time for the deal to be brokered arrives, Dany swings the slaver's whip in Kraznys' face, and releases Drogon on him, shouting, "Drogon! Dracarys!" Dany frees all the Unsullied and every other slave, and then orders the slavers killed, conquering Astapor. She rides on her white mare past all the newly freed people who call out to her as "Mother!"</p>

<h2>Sansa (III) {XVII}    pg 316</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Garth Tyrell (called the Gross, Lord Seneschal of Highgarden, uncle of Lord Mace Tyrell, brother of the late Lord Luthor, Ser Moryn and Maester Gormon).</p>
<p>Sansa is dressing in the gown Cersei had made for her, thinking to herself what it would be like to marry Willas Tyrell. However, her daydreams are shattered when the Queen reveals that she is to marry Tyrion that very afternoon. Sansa does her duty, realizing there is no way out. Tyrion apologizes to her, saying that it was his lord father's wish to see them wed. During the ceremony, Sansa does not bend to allow Tyrion to place his cloak over her shoulders, causing embarrasment for the dwarf. At the feast, Ser Garlan comforts Sansa, saying that Tyrion will make a good husband, "He is a bigger man than he seems." When the time comes to have them bedded, Tyrion demands that there will be no bedding. He has to threaten Joff to keep him from making the tense moment worse. In bed that night, Tyrion realizes that Sansa is petrified at the thought of losing her maidenhood to him, and he tells her, "...I cannot do this. My father be damned. On my honor as a Lannister, I will not touch you until you want me to."</p>

<h2>Arya (V) {XX}   pg 327</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Tansy (proprietor of a brothel called the Peach in Stoney Sept);</p>
<p>Bella, Cass, Lanna, Jyzene, Alyce (Tansy's "peaches");</p>
<p>The Mad Huntsman (outlaw hunter who works loosely with the brotherhood without banners).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Jon Connington* (Hand of King Aerys during the early days of the War of the Uprising, succeeded Lord Owen Merryweather as Hand, exiled by King Aerys II after losing the Battle of the Bells; died in exile);</p>
<p>Ser Denys Arryn* (the darling of the Vale, cousin of Lord Jon Arryn, killed by Lord Jon Connington during the Battle of the Bells; served as Keeper of the Gates of the Moon after the death of his other cousin Ser Ronnel Arryn). </p>
<p>            Harwin tells Arya about the Battle of the Bells, where her father defeated Lord Connington the Hand in a fierce battle fought in the streets of Stoney Sept. Robert Baratheon was injured and hiding in the city when the Hand's army invaded the town. Many credit Robert with the victory, but the King always said that Eddard had won that battle. Arya is disturbed to find Northmen being starved in cages, and gives one of them water. They were Karstark men captured by the Mad Huntsman. That night while asleep in the brothel, they hear a commotion, and watch as the Mad Huntsman brings Sandor Clegane into the city in chains.</p>

<h2>Jon (IV) {XXI}   pg 336</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Errok* (one of Jarl's raiders). </p>
<p>            Jon is watching as Jarl's men are competing with the Magnar's to see who will reach the top of the Wall first. Many of the climbers fall to their death, including Jarl, but several eventually reach the top. As long rope ladders are dropped down to the base to allow the others to climb, Jon notices Ygritte with tears in her eyes. She tells him that they never found the Horn of Joramun which would have helped them bring the Wall down without a fight.</p>

<h2>Jaime (IV)   pg 342</h2></p>
<p>On the way to Harrenhal, Jaime's wound is infected, and he is feverish from the loss of his hand. When some of the Mummers come to rape Brienne, Jaime advises her to take her mind far away, much as he had done when Aerys had cooked Lord Rickard Stark alive while Brandon died trying to rescue him. But Jaime saves her again by yelling “Sapphires” loud enough for the Goat to hear. Brienne thanks him as Jaime considers the debt he owes to Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers, a Lannister always pays his debts. Hoat presents the Kingslayer to Lord Bolton, who is disgusted that the Mummers hacked off his hand. Qyburn cleanses the stump and bandages it.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (IV) {XXVIII}    pg 352</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Martyn Lannister (a squire, son of Ser Kevan, twin brother of Willem and younger brother of Ser Lancel, once held captive at Riverrun);</p>
<p>Gerion Lannister* (called Gery, youngest brother of Lord Tywin, Ser Kevan, Lady Genna, and Ser Tygett; lost at sea trying to recover the Lannisters' ancestral greatsword).</p>
<p>Legends: King Tommen II (ancestor of the Lannisters, King of Casterly Rock, lost the greatsword ‘Brightroar' on his fool's quest to Valyria).</p>
<p>Tyrion visits Symon Silvertongue, and thinks to pay him to leave King's Landing. But the singer wishes to join the tournament of singers that will take place during Joff's wedding. Tyrion tells him that one of the singers will be removed, and Bronn will visit him in three days time. Outside, Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Symon. Later, Lord Tywin shows him the two new Valyrian swords he had made for Joffrey and Ser Jaime. Master Mott reworked the metal, and the color of the blade on each sword is black and red. Tywin had Ice taken from Ser Ilyn Payne and melted down to form the two new blades. House Lannister had not had a Valyrian sword in hundreds of years, and try as he might, Tywin could never get any of the lesser houses to sell theirs. Tywin tells him that he must consummate his marriage to Sansa, and that Mace Tyrell rejected the marriage proposal between Cersei and Willas, probably because the Queen of Thorns told him to. Pycelle brings dire tidings from the Wall, and that Maester Aemon fears Lord Mormont is dead. Tywin tells Pycelle to send a letter that no men shall be sent to the Wall unless Lord Janos Slynt is considered for the post of Lord Commander. Tyrion thinks to himself that he should have had Slynt and Pycelle put to death when he had had the chance.</p>

<h2>Samwell (II)   pg 365</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ronnel Harclay, Alan of Rosby, Tim Stone, Garth Greyfeather, Garth of Greenaway, Ser Byam Flint*, Fornio*, Garth of Oldtown* (rangers of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Ulmer of the Kingswood (ranger, once an outlaw member of the Kingswood Brotherhood);</p>
<p>Rolley of Sisterton* (steward, cousin of Lark the Sisterman; killed at Craster's Keep);</p>
<p>Muttering Bill, Orphan Oss (stewards of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Dyah, Ferny, Nella (Craster's daughter-wives).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Simon Toyne* (leader of the outlaws known as the Kingswood Brotherhood, slain by Ser Barristan the Bold);</p>
<p>The Smiling Knight* (a great warrior and right hand of Simon Toyne; described as "a madman, cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up together"; slain by Ser Arthur Dayne);</p>
<p>Wenda the White Fawn* (female member of the Kingswood Brotherhood who branded her captives; held Merrett Frey captive; potentially still alive);</p>
<p>Oswyn Longneck the Thrice-Hanged*, Fletcher Dick*, Big Belly Ben* (members of the Kingswood Brotherhood, unknown if all are dead).</p>
<p>Forty-four survivors reached Craster's Keep from the 300 men the Watch had at the Fist. Some of the men are becoming ornery because there is so little food, and Craster seems to be hiding a larder. Mormont speaks with Sam about dragonglass, noting in disgust that the Watch once knew the purpose of obsidian weapons. Their true enemies were the Others, but they had forgotten. Craster soon makes it clear he wants the crows gone, and several members start to accuse him of not sharing all his food. The argument worsens, until finally Craster attacks Clubfoot Karl. Dirk slits Craster's throat, and when Mormont screams at them that there is no crime worse than murder at a host's dinner table, Ollo Lophand stabs the Lord Commander. Sam watches in horror as the deserters begin to rape Craster's wives, and sees the few men still loyal to the Watch flee because they are outnumbered. Grenn, Giant, Dolorous Edd and a few others get away. Mormont, dying, commands Sam to return to the Wall with all haste. His last words to Sam are, "Tell Jorah. Forgive him. My son. Please. Go." Gilly, who had recently given birth to a son, asks Sam to take her with him. Sam and Gilly flee Craster's Keep on horseback.</p>

<h2>Arya (VI) {XXI}   pg 381</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Edric Dayne (called Ned, Lord of Starfall and bannerman to the Martells, squire to Lord Beric Dondarrion and member of the forgotten fellowship, his father was Lord of Starfall before him; nephew of Ser Arthur Dayne, Lady Ashara Dayne, and Lady Allyria; cousin of Darkstar);</p>
<p>Dennet, Kyle* (archers of the brotherhood without banners);</p>
<p>Melly (member of the brotherhood).</p>
<p>Arya and Gendry are blindfolded until they reach Hollow Hill, the secret base of the forgotten fellowship. Sandor Clegane is brought bound before Thoros of Myr, and Arya cannot believe how different the red priest looks. The Hound is to be judged by Lord Beric and hung if found guilty. Thoros is a changed man, no longer a fat priest with a fake flaming sword, "I am not the false priest you knew. The Lord of Light has woken in my soul. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land."</p>
<p>When Lord Beric appears, Arya is appalled by his appearance. Once handsome, the man is now stick thin, missing an eye, with part of his skull crushed in, a noose scar around his neck, and a terrible wound through his chest. Lord Beric asks for charges to be made against Sandor, but the Hound spits at the accusations, laying them at the hands of his brother and others. But Arya accuses him of killing Mycah, and the Hound does not refute that. The Lightning Lord sentences him to trial by battle, and it will be Lord Beric he faces. Before the fight, Thoros says a prayer to R'hllor, and then Lord Beric cuts open his palm with his sword, causing the blade to take fire. The fight ends with Clegane's shield destroyed and his left arm in flames, but the Hound cut Lord Beric near in half from shoulder to navel. Sandor is screaming in pain and fear from the hideous burn to his arm. When Arya confronts him about Mycah, Clegane admits killing the boy, and suddenly Lord Beric appears, alive and leaning against Thoros, to tell Sandor he has gone to hell.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (IV) {XXII}    pg 392</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lothar Frey (Lame Lothar, eldest son of Lord Walder and his fourth wife, brother of Ser Jammos, Ser Whalen, Morya Brax, and Tyta the Maid);</p>
<p>Ser Walder Rivers (Bastard Walder, eldest of Lord Walder's bastard sons, father of Ser Aemon Rivers and Walda Rivers).</p>
<p>Lord Hoster Tully has finally passed away, and his family and bannermen are gathered for the funeral. Lame Lothar and Bastard Walder have come to Riverrun to negotiate a meeting between Robb and Lord Walder that will hopefully reunite them. The Lord of Riverrun is placed on a funeral pyre boat, and when Ser Edmure tries to launch a fire arrow at the ship to light it, he misses three times. Ser Brynden takes the bow and hits the boat, causing it to catch fire. Later, Robb is devastated by the news from Duskendale, shocked that Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart took it upon themselves to attack such an insignificant castle, losing nearly a third of Robb's infantry. The king tells his mother of Sansa's marriage to the Imp, and Cat begs him to bend the knee and make peace with the Lannisters, but Robb will not hear it. At dinner, Lothar tells them that his father received word from Little Walder and Big Walder at the Dreadfort, that Winterfell had been burned and Ser Rodrik Cassel killed. Lothar remarks that Lord Bolton's bastard son rescued the survivors from Winterfell, to Cat's disbelief. Lothar brings his father's terms that Robb appear in person to offer apology, and that Lord Edmure marry Roslin Frey immediately. Robb dismisses Lothar and Bastard Walder, and when Edmure balks at not being able to choose his wife, the Blackfish reminds him that he must make amends for his blunder with the Battle of the Fords.</p>

<h2>Davos (IV) {VII}   pg 404</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Cafferen* (Lord of Fawnton, original remained loyal to the Targaryens, lord sworn to Storm's End whom Robert captured during the battle at Summerhall, later fought for Robert, slain by Lord Randyll Tarly at Ashford);</p>
<p>Lord Grandison* (Lord of Grandview, remained loyal to King Aerys originally, then captured and went over to Robert's side, died from a wound suffered on the Trident).</p>
<p>Legends: Prince Daemon Blackfyre (first and greatest of the Blackfyre Pretenders, the Black Dragon, Daemon the Pretender, also called “The King Who Bore the Sword” by his supporters; eldest and highest born of King Aegon IV's 4 “Great Bastards”, his mother was Princess Daena Targaryen who was Aegon IV's cousin; started the Blackfyre Rebellion during the reign of his half-brother Daeron the Good; slain by his half-brother Lord Bloodraven on the Redgrass Field; legitimized by his father with his half-brothers and half-sister; Aegon IV gave the hereditary Targaryen Sword of Kings ‘Blackfyre' to Daemon rather than his trueborn son Daeron);</p>
<p>Princess Daena Targaryen (Daena the Defiant, daughter of King Aegon III, sister of King Daeron I, sister and briefly wife of King Baelor the Beloved until he annulled the marriage and kept her under “comfortable confinement” in the Maidenvault; one of the "Three Maidens in the Tower" along with her sisters Rhaena and Alaena; later she was one of her cousin Aegon IV's mistresses, and bore him his highest born bastard son Daemon Blackfyre);</p>
<p><NOTE: All the above info on Daena and some of the info on Daemon comes from Mr. Martin's correspondence with the artist Roman Papsuev. Daena has yet to be mentioned in any of the novels, so the info above is included as important background. For more info on the other 3 “Great Bastards” of Aegon IV, see the Summary for “The Sworn Sword”, George RR Martin's second Dunk and Egg novella></p>
<p>Lord Belgrave (commanded by Baelor the Blessed to wash the beggar's ulcerated feet);</p>
<p>Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (elder half-sister of Aegon II, contested her brother's claim to the Iron Throne starting the Dance of the Dragons; eaten by her brother's dragon during the war; mother of Aegon III and Viserys II, daughter of Viserys I).</p>
<p>Ser Axell brings Davos before King Stannis, taking the torch to leave his brother alone in the darkness. Axell tells Davos that he has seen Stannis' victory in the flames, and if Davos does not help him become Hand, he will see the Onion Knight killed. Stannis proclaims that Lord Alester will die for treason, and tells Davos that Ser Axell wishes to resume the war and invade Claw Isle. Davos calls the plan a folly, and Stannis dismisses Axell. Stannis mentions that Ser Barristan once told him that ‘the rot in King Aerys' reign began with Varys', and that Robert should have killed the eunuch, and sent Ser Jaime to the Wall as Lord Eddard had suggested (but Robert listened to Jon Arryn instead).</p>
<p>Stannis then raises Ser Davos to Lord and names him Hand. When Stannis mentions battle, Davos mistakes him to mean the continuance of the war, but Melisandre has entered the room and calls it "the great battle...Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends." Stannis has also seen a vision in the Red Woman's flames- of him standing in the snow surrounded by men in black with torches, while all around them shapes closed in. Melisandre proclaims that Westeros must unite under King Stannis in order to defeat the one whose name must not be spoken. The King takes three leeches and tosses them one at a time into a brazier, naming each of the false kings: Joffrey, Robb, and Balon Greyjoy. Melisandre tells him that this is not the best way, for it both will and will not work. The better way is to sacrifice Edric Storm to the flames, for there is power in a king's blood, but Stannis will not hear of it. Melisandre tells him that the death of Edric Storm will wake the stone dragon in the prophecy, and the sacrifice of one life to save thousands of others is warranted.</p>

<h2>Jaime (V)   pg 416</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Jonothor Darry* (called Jon, Kingsguard of Aerys II, died at the Trident);</p>
<p>Lord Qarlton Chelsted* (Hand of the King after Lord Connington and before Lord Rossart, burned alive by the command of King Aerys II);</p>
<p>Belis*, Garigus* (Pyromancers under Rossart, slain by Ser Jaime Lannister).</p>
<p>Jaime and Brienne are in the bathhouse in Harrenhal, washing themselves before meeting Lord Bolton. Jaime feels dizzy in the hot bath, and begins to tell Brienne his story despite his own misgivings about revealing the tale. Jaime says, "Aerys would have bathed in wildfire if he'd dared. The Targaryens were all mad for fire." After the Battle of the Bells, Aerys realized that Robert Baratheon was no mere outlaw, and that the Targaryens faced their greatest threat since the Blackfyre Pretenders. He began to disperse his Kingsguard to take command of the army, recalled Rhaegar from the south, and sent letters to Casterly Rock. But when Lord Tywin never responded, Aerys commanded his pyromancers “to place caches of wildfire throughout King's Landing.” Lord Chelsted, the current Hand, tried to stop Aerys from continuing along his mad course, but Aerys had him killed and named the pyromancer Rossart, the man who had burned Lord Rickard Stark alive, his Hand.</p>
<p>All this time, Jaime remained in the throne room guarding the king and his secrets. After the Trident, Aerys sent his wife and Prince Viserys to Dragonstone, but kept Elia and her children in the Red Keep because he thought that Prince Lewyn Martell had betrayed Rhaegar during the battle (he did not). With the wildfire in place, Aerys told Rossart, "The traitors want my city, but I'll give them naught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat." Aerys thought that the great fire would kill everyone, but transform him into a dragon, much as Aerion Brightflame had thought. Pycelle convinced Aerys to open the gates for Lord Tywin, however the king should have listened to Varys who advised him to keep the gates closed. Tywin had “held back during the war, brooding on all the wrongs Aerys had done him and determined that House Lannister should be on the winning side.” Jaime felt he had to act after the Mad King commanded him to bring him his father's head. Ser Jaime killed Lord Rossart, then snuck into the throneroom and killed King Aerys. Days later he hunted down and killed the rest of Aerys' pyromancers, so that their secret would die with them. When Brienne asks why no one else knows this tale, Jaime tells her that the Kingsguard are sworn to protect the king's secrets, and that Lord Eddard would never have believed his tale, "By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?"</p>
<p>Jaime then nearly passes out from the heat, and Brienne calls out for Qyburn. They are brought before Roose Bolton, who tells them he chose to wed Fat Walda because Lord Walder had offered him his bride's weight in silver. When Brienne inquires after Arya, Bolton mysteriously states that she was lost for a time, but she had been found and was to be returned safely to the north. Bolton tells them he awarded Harrenhal to Lord Vargo because the goat was a stranger to the Seven Kingdoms and did not know ‘the prize was poisoned'. He means the curse of Lord Tywin, not King Harren the Black, for Hoat was not aware of what Tywin did to traitors such as the Tarbecks and the Reynes. Bolton explains that he has a small problem, because the goat wishes to return Jaime to Lord Rickard Karstark to claim the Lord's reward of his daughter's hand in marriage. Vargo had Jaime's hand chopped off to send as a grisly token to Lord Tywin, feeling he would be well safe in Karhold. What he didn't know was that Robb had beheaded Lord Karstark, and the goat was now doomed. But since Vargo was in Lord Bolton's employ, Lord Tywin might feel that Bolton was responsible for the maiming as well. Jaime agrees to carry word to his father absolving Lord Bolton of all blame. But as for Brienne, Bolton tells her, "It would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo of both his prizes."</p>

<h2>Tyrion (V) {XXIX}   pg 428</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Prince Oberyn Nymeros Martell* (The Red Viper, brother of Prince Doran and the late Princess Elia, fathered eight bastard daughters collectively referred to as ‘The Sand Vipers': Obara, Nymeria, Tyene, Sarella, and 4 with Ellaria Sand; uncle of Princess Arianne, Prince Quentyn, Prince Trystane, and the late Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen; killed by Ser Gregor Clegane after mortally wounding the Mountain);</p>
<p>Ser Deziel Dalt (the Knight of Lemonwood, elder brother of Ser Andrey; a landed knight);</p>
<p>Lord Tremond Gargalen (Lord of Salt Shore, bannerman of the Martells);</p>
<p>Lord Harmen Uller (Lord of Hellholt, bannerman of the Martells, natural father of Ellaria Sand, elder brother of Ser Ulwyck);</p>
<p>Ser Ulwyck Uller (brother of Lord Harmen, heir to Hellholt);</p>
<p>Ser Ryon Allyrion (knight sworn to Sunspear, only son and heir of Lady Delonne Allyrion [the Lady of Godsgrace]);</p>
<p>Ser Daemon Sand (the Bastard of Godsgrace, bastard son of Ser Ryon Allyrion; once a squire to Prince Oberyn; later arrested by command of Prince Doran for plotting to free the Sand Snakes);</p>
<p>Lord Dagos Manwoody (Lord of Kingsgrave, bannerman to the Martells, elder brother of Ser Myles, father of Mors and Dickon);</p>
<p>Ser Myles Manwoody (brother of Lord Dagos, uncle of Mors and Dickon);</p>

<p>Ser Arron Qorgyle (knight sworn to Sunspear, second son of Lord Quentyn Qorgyle [Lord of Sandstone]);</p>
<p>Myria Jordayne (heir to the Tor, daughter of Lord Trebor Jordayne);</p>
<p>Lady Larra Blackmont (Lady of Blackmont, bannerlady to the Martells, mother of Jynessa and Perros);</p>
<p>Jynessa Blackmont (Lady Larra's daughter, heir to Blackmont);</p>
<p>Perros Blackmont (a squire, son of Lady Larra);</p>
<p>Ellaria Sand (Prince Oberyn's paramour, bastard daughter of Lord Harmen Uller, mother of 4 bastard daughters with Prince Oberyn: Elia, Obella, Dorea and Loreza);</p>
<p>Ser Merlon Crakehall (knight sworn to Casterly Rock, youngest son of Lord Roland Crakehall, brother of Strongboar).</p>
<p>Tyrion has been sent to greet the 300 Dornishmen with a small retinue. However, he is shocked when he finds that the Dornishmen are being led by Prince Oberyn Martell and not his brother, Prince Doran. The Red Viper of Dorne had an infamous reputation for using poisoned weapons in battle. The man had fought in the Free Cities and even formed his own sellsword company, he had studied at the Citadel for a time, and had crippled Willas Tyrell in a tourney years before. The Red Viper tells Tyrion the story of how he and Elia had traveled to Casterly Rock when the Imp was an infant. They were ignored by Lord Tywin the whole time, supposedly because he was in mourning after his wife's death. He and Elia were disappointed to find out that Tyrion was only a dwarf, after the stories they had heard about him being Lord Tywin's monster son. The Red Viper then gets down to the point, asking Tyrion, "when will justice be served?" He warns Tyrion that he does not mean to stop after killing Gregor Clegane, "Before he dies, the Enormity that Rides will tell me whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that." But Tyrion has a more subtle warning that the Lannisters have tens of thousands of Tyrell men as allies, for the Tyrells hate the Dornish, and especially Prince Oberyn for what he did to Willas.</p>

<h2>Arya (VII) {XXII}   pg 439</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Beardless Dick, Mudge, Watty the Miller, Merrit o' Moontown, Puddingfist, Likely Luke (members of Lord Beric's outlaw brotherhood);</p>
<p>Septon Utt* (sergeant of the Bloody Mummers, claimed to be a 'man of god'; hanged by Lord Beric Dondarrion).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Burton Crakehall* (brother of Lord Roland, slain by Lord Beric Dondarrion).</p>
<p>The Lightning Lord's band is attacking a town held by several members of the Bloody Mummers. Arya watches as Lord Beric and Thoros seem to be everywhere at once, both with flaming swords in hand. Afterward, they hang the Mummer called Septon Utt for his crimes. Arya was upset that Lord Beric had let Sandor free after taking all his gold. That night, Lord Beric is speaking to Arya and asks Thoros, "How many times have you brought me back now?" Thoros claims it is R'hllor who has restored his life six times, but the seventh may be the end of both of them. Beric reveals that he has trouble remembering his past, and would be unable to even find his ancestral home. Thoros believes that the Lord of Light is not done with Lord Beric yet, and that is why the red god has raised him from the dead so many times. The outlaws plan to ransom Arya back to her mother or brother. Later, Gendry joins the outlaws as a blacksmith, and is knighted by Lord Beric. Soon after, Sandor Clegane returns, claiming he killed the sentries. He demands his gold back, but is rebuffed by Thoros and commanded to leave. The Hound leaves realizing he cannot do anything, and they then discover that the sentries were only asleep. When some complain that the Hound will follow and murder them in their sleep, Lord Beric states, "Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly, but not in our sleep."</p>

<h2>Bran (III) {XVII}   pg 453</h2></p>
<p>Legends: Queen Alysanne Targaryen (Good Queen Alysanne, wife and sister of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator, bequeathed the New Gift to the Night's Watch, grandmother of King Viserys I [there seems to be some confusion as to whether Viserys I was the Old King's son or grandson, but I am fairly certain he was the grandson]);</p>
<p>Silverwing (Queen Alysanne's dragon).</p>
<p>Bran and the others reach a small, deserted village on a lake. There is a holdfast tower on an island in the middle of the lake, and Bran tells them that Good Queen Alysanne had once stayed there. Brandon's Gift was all the lands south of the Wall to a distance of 25 leagues, and the New Gift had doubled that distance, given to the Watch by Queen Alysanne and her husband, King Jaehaerys I. Bran tells them there is a secret walkway just beneath the lake's surface that will allow them to reach the tower. They stay in the tower that night during a terrible thunderstorm, and Bran tells them that all the gates through the Wall were sealed when each of the castles had to be abandoned, leaving only three gates open at each of the manned castles. When Hodor starts to scream in fear of the thunder, Bran reaches out to him the way he does to Summer, and calms the big man. Jojen spots men on the shore in the village, and Bran enters Summer to investigate...</p>

<h2>Jon (V) {XXII}   pg 461</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hempen Dan, Del, Henk the Helm, Toefinger, Big Boil*, Quort*, Bodger*, Stone Thumbs* (raiders in Jarl's band, most die attacking Castle Black from the south).</p>
<p>Jon is with the Magnar's men nearing the village alongside the lake. He realizes that he must somehow escape and reach Castle Black before the raiders do, in order to warn them. The Thenns captured an old man camped in one of the ruined houses, and Styr commands Jon to kill the man. Jon balks, but Ygritte slits the man's throat with her dagger. As Styr begins to command his men in the old tongue, a crash of thunder sounds, and suddenly a direwolf is attacking the Thenns. Jon mistakes the wolf for Ghost for a moment, never realizing that it is Summer. The direwolf slaughters several wildlings, and in the confusion, Jon mounts the old man's horse and begins to flee. He is hit with an arrow in the calf, believing the shot was fired by Ygritte. Jon gets away, forcing the horse to gallop for hours without rest, heading for Castle Black.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (IV) {XIX}    pg 473</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Grey Worm (field commander of the Unsullied);</p>
<p>Daario Naharis (Tyroshi, Captain of the sellsword company called the Stormcrows, later one of Dany's commanders);</p>
<p>Prendahl na Ghezn* (Ghiscari, one of the Stormcrows' captains, beheaded by Daario Naharis);</p>
<p>Sallor the Bald* (Quartheen, captain of the Stormcrows, killed by Daario Naharis);</p>
<p>Mero of Braavos* (the Titan's Bastard, Captain of the sellsword company called the Second Sons, slain by Ser Barristan Selmy);</p>
<p>Grazdan mo Eraz* (master slaver of Yunkai).</p>
<p>Dany and her army of Unsullied reach Yunkai, to find the city guarded by a huge force including two sellsword companies. She knows that open battle will cost her many lives, even though her commanders feel she will win easily. Dany tells her men to invite the two sellsword Captains, as well as the Yunkish leader. The first to arrive are the three Captains of the Stormcrows, who spurn her offer to join her, although she notices Daario Naharis smile at her as they leave. The Captain of the Second Sons also laughs at her offer, but does accept a wagonload of wine to bring to his men. The master slaver brings Dany chests full of gold hoping she will leave Yunkai alone, but she sends him off with his gold and a warning that she will attack in three days time. </p>
<p>After he leaves, Dany tells her commanders that they will attack that night, since none of Yunkai's defenders will be expecting it. Soon after, Daario returns with the heads of the other two Stormcrow Captains, and swears the service of his company. Jorah warns her not to trust the Tyroshi, yet she commands the battle to commence as planned. During the fight, she asks Arstan to tell her more of her brother Rhaegar. Whitebeard explains that the Prince was always melancholy, and a sense of doom hung over him. "He was born in grief, and that shadow hung over him all his days." Dany knows that it was the shadow of Summerhall that Arstan was referring to. Word arrives that her army won the battle easily during the night, with the help of the Stormcrows, and all the Second Sons too drunk to fight. Dany commanded her men to spare any who threw down their swords, and promised to free any slaves. Once again, Dany's army swells to even greater size.</p>

<h2>Arya (VIII) {XXIII}    pg 489</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Notch (archer of the brotherhood without banners).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lady Allyria Dayne* (Ned Dayne's aunt, sister of Ned's father, Ser Arthur, and Lady Ashara; unknown if she is dead).</p>
<p>Gendry mentions that Master Mott considered Thoros a false priest, and he agrees. He was sent to the Seven Kingdoms to bring word of R'hllor, but he spent his time eating and whoring. King Robert was fond of him, and many enjoyed the sight of his flaming sword in melees. Lord Beric silences Thoros by saying, "Fire consumes. It consumes, and when it is done there is nothing left. Nothing." The outlaws reach High Heart again, and the ancient dwarf woman calls Beric the Lord of Corpses, for the stink of the grave is fresh on him. The Ghost of High Heart tells them her dreams: the kraken king is dead, and Lord Hoster too; the goat sits alone in the hall of kings in a fever "as the great dog descends on him"; she dreamt of drums and pipes and screams making a great clangor; and "of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow." Suddenly, she spots Arya, and calls her "blood child...you are cruel to come to my hill. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here dark heart!" When Beric tells the old dwarf woman that Arya is being brought to Riverrun, she tells them to seek her mother at the Twins, for there is to be a wedding. She then demands a song as payment for her dreams, the same song she always requests from Tom, Jenny of Oldstones.</p>
<p>Later, Arya speaks with Edric Dayne, who is called Ned like her father. Edric tells her that he saw her father during the Hand's tourney while he squired for Lord Beric. He reveals that Beric was promised to his aunt, “but that was before he died”, Arya thought to herself. Ned tells her of Wylla, the mother of Jon Snow and Edric's wetnurse. She has been in the service of the Daynes for years, and Ned is surprised that Arya's father never spoke of her nor of the Lady Ashara, Ned's aunt. He tells Arya that her father and Ashara had fallen in love during the tourney at Harrenhal, and that she had killed herself after the war because her heart was broken. Arya does not believe the young squire and Lord of Starfall, believing her father only loved her mother. She asks Harwin about it, and he confirms that Lord Eddard and Lady Ashara may have fallen in love at Harrenhal, but at the time his brother Brandon was betrothed to Lady Catelyn. He tells her Ashara killed herself over grief for her brother, and tells Arya "Let it lie, my lady. They're dead, all of them." When the outlaws come upon a ruined town, Arya thinks the Lannisters destroyed it, but she is told that the town was destroyed years before by Lord Hoster Tully, because Lord Goodbrook, the lord of the town, had fought for the Targaryens during the war. Later, Thoros sees in his flames that Riverrun will soon come under attack by the Lannisters again, and he believes the Ghost's dream that Catelyn and Robb are at the Twins. That night, Arya sneaks off while everyone else is asleep, feeling the outlaws could not be her pack if they wanted to ransom her off to her brother, mother, or uncle Brynden. But she is captured by the Hound while racing through the woods...</p>

<h2>Jaime (VI)   pg 500</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Steelshanks Walton (a soldier of iron loyalty from the Dreadfort);</p>
<p>Three Toes, Pyg* (Bloody Mummers; Pyg is slain at the Whispers by Brienne).</p>
<p>Lord Bolton had left Harrenhal to the Goat, but before marching for the Twins he told Jaime to give his warm regards to his father. Jaime responds, "So long as you give mine to Robb Stark." Jaime is now traveling for King's Landing under the protection of Steelshanks Walton and a host of Dreadfort men. Qyburn tells him that Lord Selwyn has promised Vargo Hoat 300 gold dragons for the safe return of his daughter, but the goat still believes there are sapphires in Evenfall Hall. One night, Jaime has a bizarre fever dream that he and Brienne are trapped in the dank caverns beneath Casterly Rock. He sees the shades of the other knights of the Kingsguard as well as Prince Rhaegar, come to judge him for killing Aerys. After the fire of his sword goes out, Brienne's continues to burn, defending him from the shades. </p>
<p>When Jaime awakens, he commands Walton to return to Harrenhal so he can try to rescue Brienne. Back at Harrenhal, the goat's men open the gates, and Jaime finds that Brienne has been tossed into the bear pit with only a tourney sword. Vargo Hoat, with a bandage around his face from where Brienne bit off his ear, will not pull the woman up. Jaime jumps into the pit to save Brienne, and holds off the bear long enough for Walton's men to fill it with quarrels. The Mummers are unable to stop them because Steelshanks outnumbers them two to one. Vargo begs Jaime to tell his father that he had been merciful, and the Kingslayer promises that the goat will receive his ransom. When Brienne asks him why he came back, Jaime responds that he had dreamed of her.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (V) {XXIII}    pg 514</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Dacey Mormont* (daughter of Lady Maege, one of Robb's battle companions; murdered at the Red Wedding);</p>
<p>Lord Lymond Goodbrook (one of Edmure's battle companions, attends the Red Wedding).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Jenny of Oldstones* (lover of the Prince of Dragonflies, possibly the daughter of the Ghost of High Heart, died in the tragedy at Summerhall).</p>
<p>Legends: King Tristifer IV Mudd (the Hammer of Justice, legendary River King, killed by the Andals);</p>
<p>King Tristifer V (last of the River Kings and of House Mudd, son of Tristifer IV, slain by the Storm King [an Andal king who, assumedly, extended the Stormlands to include the Riverlands]).</p>
<p>Traveling in the rain to the Twins, Cat recalls Robb sending Ser Rolph Spicer to deliver Martyn Lannister to the Golden Tooth in an exchange of captives. We also learn Robett Glover had been put on a ship at Duskendale as part of the agreement. Robb had left his wife at Riverrun, and only Ser Raynald Westerling traveled with them. Robb has brought 3500 men with him, those who had been with him since the Whispering Wood, and who would follow him to Moat Cailin after the wedding. Cat thinks to herself of Theon Greyjoy boasting about how he had almost crossed swords with Ser Jaime, If Theon had died in place of Lord Karstark's sons, how much ill would have been undone?</p>
<p>When they reach Oldstones, Cat recalls how the ruins had once been a great castle of the River Kings during the Mudd Dynasty. The Mudds were First Men, but during the time of King Tristifer IV, the kingdoms of the First Men were falling before the onslaught of the Andals. Tristifer IV died when seven Andal kings joined forces against him. Robb tells his mother that he plans to legitimize his brother Jon and name him heir should he and Jeyne not have a child. Cat is stunned by this proclamation, and pleads with him not to make the mistake the Targaryens had when King Aegon IV legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed. The Blackfyre Pretenders had plagued the Targaryens for five generations until Ser Barristan slew Maelys Blackfyre on the Stepstones. She pleads that Robb consider his sister Arya as heir, because naming Sansa will give the Imp control of Winterfell.</p>
<p>Lord Jason Mallister soon joins Robb's force, bringing with him the captain of the Myraham. The man tells them that Balon Greyjoy fell to his death when a wind blew him off one of the bridges between the towers of Pyke, and no sooner was he dead than Euron Crow's Eye returned and claimed the Seastone Chair, naming himself King of the Iron Islands and the North. Knowing Victarion and Asha will not stand still for this, Robb commands Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover to take men by longship and sail through the marshes of the Neck to seek out Lord Howland Reed. Robb plans to march on Moat Cailin with 12000 men once he joins with Roose Bolton. The crannogmen will guide a small force under Robb's command across the swamps in order to reach Moat Cailin from the north. When Galbart warns him what should happen if the crannogmen were to fail him, Robb replies, "They will not fail. My father knew the worth of Howland Reed." Robb then announces that Cat will be taken to Seagard under the protection of Lord Jason after the wedding. He then calls his bannermen to fix their seals as witnesses to the decree naming his heir.</p>

<h2>Samwell (III)   pg 528</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ryles* (ranger of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Coldhands (?!?).</p>
<p>Sam and Gilly have reached what appears to be Whitetree, and Sam prays to the old gods to protect them. They camp in one of the huts for the night, but Sam is woken by shapes moving within. The corpse of Small Paul comes after Sam, and he tries to stab it with the obsidian dagger, but it shatters upon contact with Paul's chainmail. Despairing, Sam thrusts a burning stick from the campfire in the wight's mouth, setting it on fire. Outside the hut, the wights begin to surround Gilly and her infant son after killing their horse. Thinking all is lost, a raven lands on Sam's shoulder, and suddenly thousands of ravens fly from the branches of the weirwood tree to tear the wights to pieces. The raven tells Sam to "Go", and he and Gilly begin to run south, but without their horse they are doomed. Suddenly a voice calls out, "Brother! Here." And from the falling snow appears a man dressed all in black astride a great elk! But when Sam reaches up for the man's bare hand, Sam notices his hand was black and cold as ice...</p>

<h2>Arya (IX) {XXIV}   pg 537</h2></p>
<p>Arya attempts to kill the Hound at night while the man is asleep, but Clegane awakens and takes the rock from her hands. They reach Lord Harroway's Town, but find it flooded. Sandor promises to pay some ferryman to take them across the Trident, but gives them only the parchment Lord Beric had given him promising reimbursement after the war. Arya tells Sandor that she had once been captured by his brother, and the Hound finds it interesting that Gregor never knew who he had caught. Clegane says, "I'll be sure and tell him that, before I cut his heart out." Sandor tells her that he saved Sansa's life when the mob tried to kill her, and realizes from Arya's expression that the "wolf bitch" hates the "pretty bird". The Hound informs her that he is taking her to the Twins, and will ransom her to Robb and perhaps join the Young Wolf's service, because "even a dog gets tired of being kicked."</p>

<h2>Jon (VI) {XXIII}   pg 546</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Wynton Stout (a ranger for 80 years, one of the few knights remaining at Castle Black).</p>
<p>Jon reaches Mole's Town and warns the populace to evacuate. At Castle Black, Jon learns that Jarman Buckwell and his men have returned with tidings of Mance's army. He discovers that the wildlings have been feinting all along the Wall, and groups of black brothers have been dispersed to counter them. Maester Aemon also tells him that Mormont was betrayed and killed, and that only 12 men made it back from Craster's keep, including Giant, Grenn, Dywen, Sweet Donnel Hill and Dolorous Edd. Aemon cleans and wraps Jon's wound, and Grenn tells him that Winterfell has been burned to the ground and that Bran and Rickon are dead at the hands of Theon. Jon tells them that there is some kind of mistake, for he saw a grey direwolf at Queenscrown, and maybe Bran lives on through his direwolf...</p>

<h2>Catelyn (VI) {XXIV}    pg 555</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Ryman Frey* (only son of Ser Stevron and his first wife, became heir to the twins when Ser Stevron died, grandson of Lord Walder; father of Edwyn, Black Walder and Petyr Pimple; hanged by Lady Stoneheart);</p>

<p>Four Freys ride out to welcome Robb's army, but Ser Ryman is angered that Queen Jeyne is not amongst them. The army is to cross the bridge and join Lord Walder's and Lord Bolton's men beneath pavilions erected for the wedding. Robb and his retainers will have rooms in the Water Tower, but Lame Lothar advises that Grey Wind be kept in the kennels. Lord Walder is relentless in his veiled insults against Robb, making it clear that the King betrayed him by breaking his solemn oath. Robb apologizes, and then Roslin is brought out, by far the most beautiful of Walder's get. After Edmure meets his soon-to-be-bride, Cat asks the Lord of the Crossing for bread and salt, and the old man welcomes them as guests to his table. When Lord Bolton joins them, Robb finds out more of what happened at Winterfell, and his bannerman tells him that Ramsay rescued many of the women and has been fighting the ironmen. Bolton again states that his bastard son's blood is tainted, but maybe his deeds will atone for the crimes he committed. He tells them that Ramsay is holding Theon hostage, and he shows them a piece of Greyjoy's skin. Bolton lost men crossing the Trident when Gregor Clegane's army attacked. Bolton has brought mostly Dreadfort and Karstark men, leaving all the others to guard the Trident.</p>

<h2>Arya (X) {XXV}    pg 568       </h2></p>
<p>The Hound is pretending to be a trader in the service of Lady Whent, and they learn that Arya's mother and brother are at the Twins. Sandor has stolen goods and horses, and they begin the journey to the Crossing, where Clegane hopes to ransom Arya.</p>

<p>Ser Whalen Frey (third son of Lord Walder and his fourth wife, brother of Lame Lothar, Ser Jammos, and Tyta the Maid);</p>
<p>Donnel Locke*, Owen Norrey* (Northmen sworn to King Robb; slain at the Red Wedding).</p>
<p>Catelyn listens to the continuous pounding noise of the drums the musicians in the hall are playing. She is seated between Ser Ryman Frey and Lord Bolton during the wedding feast. She remarks to herself how joyless the wedding is, and watches as Robb dances with several of the Frey maids and Edmure dotes on his soon to be wife, Roslin. Cat becomes more wary when she learns that Olyvar, Ser Perwyn and Alesander Frey are all not in attendance at the wedding. She notices Merrett Frey trying to drink the Greatjon under the table, and finally Lord Walder calls for the bedding. Robb does not participate as many of the men carry Edmure up to his wedding bed. The women do the same for the weeping Roslin. </p>
<p>Suddenly, things grow more ominous in the hall as Edwyn yells at Dacey Mormont, and the musicians begin to play "The Rains of Castamere". The musicians turn out to be crossbowmen, and the wedding becomes a slaughter. Cat watches in horror as Robb is pelted with arrows until the Smalljon throws a table over him. Ser Wendel Manderly, the Smalljon and Dacey Mormont all perish, and Cat realizes that she must try to intervene and save her son's life. She grabs Jinglebell Frey and puts a dagger to the halfwit's throat. Robb stumbles to his feet, and Cat commands him to leave the hall, but Lord Walder has already violated the laws of the hearth and will not let Robb get away. As Ser Ryman and Black Walder close on her, she sees northmen burst into the room, and one of them runs Robb through with his sword, saying, "Jaime Lannister sends his regards." Cat slits Jinglebell's throat, then begins to claw at her face and eyes, until she is grabbed from behind and feels steel drawn across her own throat...</p>

<h2>Arya (XI) {XXVI}   pg 584</h2></p>
<p>            Arya and Sandor have arrived where the armies were feasting outside the Twins. But as they approach the castle gates, hundreds of Frey men with axes come charging out, and the pavilions begin to collapse. Arya watches as Frey and Bolton men start to slaughter Robb's army, but she and the Hound are being attacked as well. After Clegane kills the group trying to stop them, he warns Arya that her brother is surely dead, "Do you think they'd slaughter his men and leave him alive?" Arya turns and tries to run for the castle gates away from the Hound, but she feels an axe hit her in the back of the head.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (VI) {XXX}   pg 588</h2></p>
<p>Tyrion joins his father and sister in the Hand's solar, and learns that Robb Stark is dead. Lord Tywin had orchestrated much of what transpired at the ‘Red Wedding' when he was penning those letters. Tyrion knows that the Blackfish, now Castellan at Riverrun, will not move while his nephew is held hostage at the Twins. When Joff and Tyrion begin to argue, the boy king then mocks his own grandfather, calling Lord Tywin a coward for hiding at Casterly Rock while his father won the war at the Trident. The Hand dismisses the king, and then warns Cersei that the boy "requires a sharp lesson." Tywin then dismisses his daughter, and tells Tyrion he plans to reveal to Prince Oberyn that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children. He admits that Lorch did kill Rhaenys, but he does not plan to lose Ser Gregor, who he recently sent to Harrenhal with orders to put the castle to the sword. Lord Tywin reveals that both Robb and Catelyn were killed at the feast table while they had guest right, and he tells Tyrion, "The blood is on Walder Frey's hands, not mine." The crown will grant Riverrun to Ser Emmon Frey, and several Lannister cousins will wed daughters of Lord Walder. Roose Bolton will become Warden of the North and gets Arya Stark, but when Tyrion questions him, the Hand will not reveal what he means.</p>

<h2>Davos (V) {VIII}   pg 597</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Gerald Gower (knight sworn to King Stannis, aids Ser Davos in saving Edric Storm from Melisandre);</p>
<p>Ser Andrew Estermont (cousin and once squire to King Stannis; nephew of Lord Eldon Estermont; currently with Edric Storm en route to the Free Cities);</p>
<p>Ser Rolland Storm (the Bastard of Nightsong, bastard son of the late Lord Bryen Caron, later Castellan of Dragonstone).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Fell* (Lord of Felwood, a lord sworn to Storm's End who defied Lord Robert by remaining loyal to the Targaryens, slain by Robert Baratheon at the battle of Summerhall);</p>
<p>Silveraxe* (Lord Fell's son, joined Robert Baratheon in his rebellion after the death of his father, unknown if dead);</p>

<p>Septon Barth (son of a blacksmith, Hand of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator for 40 years; discovered that dragons are neither male nor female, but rather changeable; most of his writings were burned by King Baelor the Beloved).</p>
<p>Salladhor Saan is telling King Stannis of the Red Wedding, how the Freys sewed the head of Robb's direwolf on the king's shoulders and nailed a crown on its head. Lady Catelyn was slain and thrown naked into the river. Queen Selyse and Ser Axell declare that it was the hand of R'hllor that killed the usurpers, but Stannis knows it was Lord Walder's handiwork. When Stannis wants to send word that he will pardon any ironman or northman who swears fealty, Melisandre tells him that her flames revealed that new kings will pick up where the old ones died. The Seven Kingdoms must be shown a sign, but Stannis has heard enough talk of stone dragons, knowing of all the follies the Targaryens caused by trying to return the dragons to life. Davos persuades the king by asking Melisandre why she needs Edric Storm's life to raise the stone dragon. He also inquires how her leeches were responsible for two kings' deaths, when one was killed by Walder Frey and the other fell from a bridge. The Red Woman has answers, but Stannis sends her away. Still not completely satisfied that he should spare Edric's life, the King sends Davos away as well. The Onion Knight seeks out Maester Pylos, who has been teaching him how to read. Davos begins to slowly read a letter that had arrived some time before from the Wall. The missive speaks of Lord Mormont's defeat at the Fist, and Maester Aemon's fear that the wildlings may conquer the Wall. Pylos reveals that he had shown the letter to Lord Alester, but the King and Melisandre were not aware of the warning's existence.</p>

<h2>Jon (VII) {XXIV}   pg 610</h2></p>

<p>Kegs, Spare Boot, Spotted Pate of Maidenpool, Young Henly* (builders of the Watch);</p>
<p>Owen the Oaf, Mully, Red Alyn of the Rosewood*, Old Henly*, Easy*, Dornish Dilly* (stewards).</p>

<p>Rodrik Flint (Lord Commander who wanted to become King-beyond-the-Wall);</p>
<p>Tristan Mudd, Mad Marq Rankenfell, Robin Hill (legendary Lords Commander of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>Donal Noye and Jon have done the best they could to fortify Castle Black from the impending attack of Styr and his raiders. The Castles along the Wall had been designed defenseless, for what greater defense was there than the Wall itself? When the Magnar and his men attack, many of the defenders die, while Jon and Satin fire arrows from one of the roofs. Jon watches as Ygritte gets hit by a crossbow bolt, and finally Donal Noye fires the powder kegs he had placed along the lower staircase of the Wall. The Magnar and the rest of his men perish as the staircase and a section of ice from the Wall crushes them. Amidst the destruction, Jon finds Ygritte, and the woman he loved briefly dies in his arms.</p>

<h2>Bran (IV) {XVIII}   pg 624</h2></p>
<p>Legends: The Rat Cook (mythological cook at the Nightfort who served an Andal king a pie baked with pieces of the prince; later supposedly changed into a giant rat);</p>
<p>King Sherrit (called down a curse on the Andals of old);</p>
<p>Night's King (legendary thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch who named himself king and married a wight, his corpse queen; killed at the Nightfort by the Stark in Winterfell and Joramun, the wildling king; Night's King himself may well have been a Stark);</p>
<p>Danny Flint (murdered and raped in the Nightfort);</p>
<p>Mad Axe (slaughtered his sworn brothers at the Nightfort);</p>
<p>Lord Ryswell (lord whose son deserted the Night's Watch, seeking sanctuary for himself and his fellow deserters; Lord Ryswell took them in custody and returned them to the Wall, where they were killed for desertion; later, Lord Ryswell took the black himself).</p>
<p>Reaching the Nightfort, Bran recalls all the horror tales he's heard about this castle. The first fortress abandoned by the Watch some two hundred years before, the Nightfort had once been the greatest castle along the Wall. Bran warns Meera and Jojen about the stories of the Rat Cook, Mad Axe and Night's King, but the Reeds are unafraid of the ancient castle. They sleep that night in the kitchens, near a seemingly bottomless well. Deep in the night, Bran is woken by footsteps coming from the well. He awakens Meera, and then takes control of Hodor's body as he does when he enters Summer.</p>
<p>But it is only Sam and Gilly who emerge from the well, carrying Gilly's infant son. Gilly asks them if they are the ones Coldhands was sent to find, but Bran has no idea what she is speaking of. Meera asks them how they got past the Wall, and Sam reveals that Coldhands had led them to the Black Gate, which only a brother of the Night's Watch can open. Sam describes Coldhands as dressed all in black like a sworn brother, but his skin and the cold from his body reminded Sam of a wight. But Coldhands could speak, his eyes did not burn blue, and he and his ravens had saved them from the wights. When the Reeds inquire why Coldhands wasn't with them, Sam tells them that the Wall was more than just ice and stone, there were ancient spells woven into it, and the Wall would not let Coldhands pass. Jojen tells Sam that Bran is the one Coldhands seeks, and Tarly realizes who Bran is, but promises not to tell anyone of Bran's whereabouts on his honor and his friendship with Jon. Jojen has Sam bring them to the Black Gate, which is an ancient white weirwood growing beneath the Wall and the Nightfort. The face in the weirwood speaks, and Sam answers by reciting his oath; the weirwood permits them to pass by opening its mouth, and as Bran and the others leave Sam behind, the boy feels a drop of water fall on him, a drop as salty as a tear...</p>

<h2>Daenerys (V) {XX}    pg 639</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Brown Ben Plumm (former sergeant, now Captain of the Second Sons; currently in Dany's service);</p>
<p>Oznak zo Pahl* (hero of the city of Meereen; killed in single combat by Strong Belwas).</p>
<p>Meereen was enclosed by a great wall, with hundreds of defenders to guard it. Dany's huge army, many of them freed slaves who could not fight but followed her out of loyalty, is eating up the surrounding lands and must claim the city before the army starves itself. Aware that storming the walls will cost her a great deal, Dany sends Strong Belwas to dispatch the Hero of Meereen. Belwas kills Oznak, but the city still stands strong. Brown Ben Plumm reveals a way into the city through the sewers, and we find out that Dany's dragons seem to like Brown Ben, and perch on his shoulder when he visits.</p>
<p> Dany, however, finds herself drawn to Daario Naharis, and keeps thinking of his blue eyes. Dany later goes off with Arstan and Missandei to visit the camps, and there she is attacked by Mero of Braavos. Arstan kills the Titan's Bastard with his staff alone, and when Dany reaches her pavilion, Ser Jorah is shocked to learn that a squire with a staff could defeat Mero with such ease. Arstan reveals that he is actually a knight, and Jorah finally recognizes him as Ser Barristan the Bold. Barristan apologizes for deceiving her, and swears his sword in her service. Ser Jorah warns her not to accept the man, for he had gone over to Robert the Usurper at the Trident. But Barristan reveals that it was Ser Jorah who had betrayed her to Varys and the small council numerous times, sending information on her whereabouts and deeds in hopes of gaining a royal pardon. Jorah pleads that he had done so only at first, but he had been loyal to her since the birth of the dragons. Dany, disgusted, dismisses them both, then realizes she can make use of them by sending them on a mission from which they had little chance of surviving.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (VII) {XXXI}    pg 654</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Brella (one of Sansa's maidservants, previously a maid of Lord Renly).</p>
<p>Tyrion visits Shae in the room where the dragon skulls are kept, but he remembers his recent conversation with Varys. The eunuch warned him that if confronted by the Queen, he would tell her the truth about Shae. Tyrion realizes that if he is to save the whore, he must either send her away or marry her off. After she pleases him, he decides that he will marry her to Ser Tallad, and the Queen will never think to find out who she is.</p>

<h2>Sansa (IV) {XVIII}    pg 659</h2></p>
<p>Legends: King Viserys II Targaryen (younger brother of King Aegon III the Dragonbane, son of Princess Rhaenyra, uncle of Kings Daeron I the Young Dragon and Baelor the Beloved; served as Hand to both King Daeron I and Baelor I; succeeded Baelor as King, possibly after poisoning him; father of King Aegon IV the Unworthy, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and Queen Naerys);</p>
<p>Grand Maester Kaeth (wrote the great tome Lives of Four Kings).</p>
<p>Sansa has learned from Tyrion the fate of her brother and mother at the Red Wedding. She and her husband join many other guests at the Queen's Ballroom to give Joff his wedding gifts. It is a new year, the 300th since Aegon's Conquest, and Joff's wedding is that night. Tyrion presents his nephew with a copy of Grand Maester Kaeth's Lives of Four Kings, one of only four copies in existence written by Kaeth himself. Ser Kevan tells the King, "A book every king should read." But Joff is disappointed in the gift, and hacks the book in half with the Valyrian sword his grandfather had just given him [Joff names the sword 'Widow's Wail', but it was made alongside Brienne's 'Oathkeeper' when Lord Tywin had Ned's greatsword 'Ice' smelted and reworked into two swords]. When Joffrey states that he is no stranger to Valyrian steel, a truth reveals itself to Tyrion- that it was Joff who sent the assassin to kill Bran. Later, back in their rooms, Sansa tells Tyrion that she would rather not know how Robb and her mother had perished, and Tyrion promises that he will say no more.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (VIII) {XXXII}    pg 667</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hamish the Harper, Collio Quaynis, Galyeon of Cuy, Alaric of Eysen (bards in King's Landing for the wedding).</p>
<p>Tyrion puzzles out how his nephew must have found Littlefinger's Valyrian dagger amongst Robert's possessions, the king probably having forgotten he even owned it. Joffrey then paid some unsavory freerider to open Bran's throat. Tyrion is slightly drunk while Joffrey and Margaery are wed in the Great Sept of Baelor, and continues drinking until night falls and it is time for the great wedding feast. As they enter the ballroom, the Queen of Thorns comes over to tell Sansa how beautiful she looks, and the old lady straightens out the hairnet that Dontos had given her. Many at the wedding offer their condolences to Sansa on the loss of her mother and brother.</p>
<p>During the feast, Joffrey calls for the royal jousters, and the party is entertained as two dwarves battle each other. Joff then mocks his uncle, commanding Tyrion to fight the dwarves as the king's champion. Tyrion rebuffs him, but the King dumps a huge goblet of wine over Tyrion's head. Joff commands Tyrion to serve him wine, and the hall erupts in laughter. Tyrion refills the goblet, and then the pigeon pie is brought out, and Joff calls for Ser Ilyn's sword. Sansa is horrified to learn that the King's Justice no longer holds her father's greatsword, Ice. Joff calls for more wine, Margaery at his side, and then begins to eat some of Tyrion's pie. The King then begins to cough, unable to breath as he claws at his throat. Lady Olenna and Margaery call out for help, but the Kingsguard are powerless to do anything. As Grand Maester Pycelle calls for his potions, Tyrion dumps the rest of the wine out on the floor, and Joff, now turning black, seems to either reach for- or point at- his uncle. Sansa has slipped off during the confusion, but when Cersei finally lets go of her son's lifeless body, she commands the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion for murdering the King.</p>

<h2>Sansa (V) {XIX}   pg 685</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Oswell Kettleblack (father of Ser Osmund, Ser Osfryd and Ser Osney; a man-at-arms in service to Littlefinger).</p>
<p>Sansa has fled to the godswood, and when she removes the hairnet, she notices that one of the black amethysts was missing. Dontos had told her she must wear it for the wedding feast, but she now realizes that the amethysts were from Asshai, and that Dontos had called the hairnet “magic”. Dontos then appears in the godswood, and Sansa accuses him of murdering the King by using one of the amethysts. Dontos denies it, telling her Tyrion has already been arrested for poisoning the King. She dresses under a heavy cloak, and Dontos leads her to the secret stairway down to the river. They are rowed out to a ship, and Sansa is shocked to find Littlefinger on board. When Dontos calls for his reward of ten thousand gold dragons, Littlefinger commands Ser Lothor Brune to kill the drunk.</p>
<p>Littlefinger explains to her that the fool had sold her for a promise of gold, and once he drank that up he would sell her whereabouts to the Queen for more gold. He reveals that it was he who wrote the note so long ago asking her to go to the godswood. Littlefinger had also planned for the dwarf jousters at the wedding, and Sansa asks him why he should wish Joffrey dead. Littlefinger responds, "I had no motive. Always keep your foes confused. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose...Remember that when you come to play the game of thrones." He then tells her that she could have been his daughter, had he and Cat wed. Again, Littlefinger believes that he had taken Cat's maidenhood, and that he could not refuse to aid the daughter of the only woman he ever loved.</p>

<h2>Jaime (VII)   pg 693</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Bertram Beesbury (knight sworn to Highgarden from Honeyholt);</p>
<p>Nage (Lord Roose Bolton's standard-bearer).</p>
<p>On the road to King's Landing, Jaime discovers that the king is dead, his firstborn son, but he is more concerned about Cersei. Jaime and Brienne had already learned of Robb Stark's demise, and had found that Lord Piper was heading to King's Landing to bend the knee since his son, Ser Marq, was held captive at the Twins. At King's Landing, Ser Loras nearly confronts Brienne for killing Renly. Jaime has to appeal to the Knight of Flowers as his Lord Commander to hold his sword. Jaime finds Cersei in the sept, and she demands that he kill Tyrion for murdering Joff. Despite Cersei's words that Tyrion threatened her when she held Alayaya prisoner, Jaime tells her he wishes to learn more of what transpired. He remarks that they should stop hiding their love and wed, even if Tommen would lose the Iron Throne, he would still be heir to Casterly Rock, but his sister sends him away in anger.</p>
<p>Jaime then visits his father, and Lord Tywin is furious when he learns that it was Vargo Hoat who maimed his son. The Hand reveals that the Mummers were routed, and that Gregor held the Goat for amusement. Tywin then speaks of bribing the High Septon to release Jaime of his vows, and perhaps marrying him to Margaery. Jaime will hear no more, stating that he is a knight of the Kingsguard, and that's all he means to be. Lord Tywin turns from his son in disgust, saying, "You are not my son. You say you are Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Very well, ser. Go do your duty."</p>

<h2>Davos (VI) {IX}   pg 705</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lewys the Fishwife, Omer Blackberry (men-at-arms in the service of King Stannis);</p>
<p>Ser Triston of Tally Hill (a knight formerly in Lord Sunglass' service).</p>
<p>Davos and a few hand-picked men he knew were loyal only to Stannis, begin their mission in the dark of night. They find Edric Storm in Pylos' solar, and the maester tells the boy to listen to Davos, as he is the King's Hand. Davos and his men bring Edric in secrecy to a ship of Sallador's, and Davos tells the boy that he must go with Ser Andrew Estermont on an adventure. With the boy safely away from Dragonstone, Davos goes to face Stannis. He tells the King that Joffrey is dead, and Melisandre states that Tommen will be named king. When she asks Stannis for the boy, the King warns her that she will pay with her life if she is wrong. Melisandre is sure that Stannis is the one prophesied 5,000 years ago, that the comet was his herald. But Davos reveals that Edric Storm is gone, and he notes that Melisandre had not foreseen this in her flames. Davos tells Stannis that a king must protect his people or he is no king at all. When Stannis draws Lightbringer to behead Davos, the Onion Knight begins to read the letter that Maester Pylos received from the Night's Watch.</p>

<h2>Jon (VIII) {XXV}   pg 714</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hareth (called Horse, former stablehand in Mole's Town);</p>
<p>Zei (whore from Mole's Town);</p>

<p>Arron, Emrick (recruits). </p>
<p>            The remaining members of the Watch from Castle Black and several people from Mole's Town man the Wall as Mance's army approaches. As the Watch repels attack after attack from their great vantage point, some of the wildlings have reached the gate. Donal Noye leaves Jon in charge as he races to defend the gate. Jon orders fire arrows and oil casks dropped on the giants and mammoths, and the defenders once again knock the wildlings back. Jon goes down to the base of the Wall, and finds Donal Noye dead alongside Mag the Mighty. When Jon brings Aemon the news, the ancient maester tells him that he must lead the Watch now.</p>

<h2>Arya (XII) {XXVII}    pg 726</h2></p>
<p>Arya dreams that she is running with a pack of wolves every night, but by day she is still Sandor's captive. The Hound had hit her with the flat of the axe to keep her from entering the Twins. Sandor now intends to take her to the Eyrie and ransom her to Lady Lysa. That night, Arya dreams the wolf dream again, and she watches as the other wolves pull corpses out of the river to eat, but she prevents them from tearing apart her mother's body. Looking at the corpse, Arya's wolf-self thinks Rise. Rise and eat and run with us. Later, she and Sandor take on work in a village, and learn that the Mountain Clans have grown bolder and now carry steel. Realizing they will never reach the Eyrie, Clegane decides to head back to Riverrun and attempt to ransom Arya to the Blackfish. Arya tells the Hound that he's lost his belly for fighting since he ran from the Battle of the Blackwater, but he just laughs at her.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (IX) {XXXIII}    pg 735</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Jothos Slynt (squire, younger son of Lord Janos).</p>
<p>Ser Kevan tells Tyrion that Lord Tywin, Lord Mace Tyrell and Prince Oberyn will stand in judgment of him. When Tyrion claims he may demand trial by combat, his uncle replies that Cersei will name Ser Gregor as her champion. Tyrion sends for Bronn, but finds the former sellsword to be a changed man, soon to marry Lollys Stokeworth, and now being paid well by the Queen. The mercenary leaves Tyrion to fend for himself, unwilling to stand for the dwarf against the Mountain. At the trial, Tyrion declares his innocence, and claims that Sansa was not responsible either. The witnesses that Cersei has brought forth are numerous, and since Tyrion has no witnesses of his own, their word is without refute. Pycelle notes that Tyrion stole poisons from his solar, and Lady Merryweather claims to have seen Tyrion drop something into the King's wine.</p>
<p>That night, Ser Kevan tells Tyrion that his only hope is to admit his guilt and he will be permitted to take the black. Kevan is fiercely loyal to his brother, for it was Tywin who made the Lannister enemies pay for their abuse of their father Lord Tytos, who was a peaceful but weak man. The next morning, Varys nearly seals Tyrion's fate with damaging evidence against the dwarf. Later, Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion, and makes it clear that Cersei has tried to buy his vote in the judgment, mentioning marriage. But the Red Viper has other ideas, and even brings up the point that according to Dornish law, Myrcella is the heir, and that his brother may well crown his ward. Prince Oberyn relates the story Lord Tywin had told him that it was Ser Amory Lorch who killed Elia and her children, but Tyrion tells him the truth- that Lorch only killed Rhaenys, and it was the Mountain who killed Aegon and raped and murdered Elia. The Red Viper speaks of saving Tyrion, not as his judge, but as his champion!</p>

<h2>Jaime (VIII)   pg 750</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Donnel Swann (heir to Stonehelm, Ser Balon's elder brother);</p>
<p>Ser Elwood Harte (a knight sworn now to King Tommen, captured Ser Donnel Swann during the Battle of the Blackwater).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Prince Duncan Targaryen* (Prince Duncan the Small, the Prince of Dragonflies; Egg's first-born son, brother of King Jaehaerys II and Princess Rhaelle Baratheon, nephew of Maester Aemon, lover of Jenny of Oldstones; perished in the Tragedy at Summerhall);</p>
<p>Ser Lyonel Selmy* (of Harvest Hall, Ser Barristan's father);</p>
<p>Ser Manfred Swann* (knight whom Ser Barristan squired for);</p>
<p>Ser Gwayne Gaunt* (Kingsguard during Aerys II's early reign, killed by Ser Symon Hollard during the Defiance of Duskendale);</p>
<p>Lormelle Long Lance* (defeated by Ser Barristan);</p>
<p>Cedrik Storm* (the Bastard of Bronzegate, defeated by Ser Barristan);</p>
<p>Lady Jeyne Swann* (Lady of Stonehelm, rescued from the Kingswood Brotherhood by Barristan);</p>
<p>The Bastard of Uplands* (a mystery knight in the tourney at Oldtown called Blackshield);</p>
<p>Ser Robert Stone* (bastard from the Vale, supposedly knighted Ser Osmund Kettleblack, if he even exists).</p>
<p>Legends: Maelys Blackfyre (Maelys the Monstrous, last of the Blackfyre Pretenders, commander of the famed sellsword Golden Company once commanded by Bittersteel; slain by Ser Barristan Selmy on the Stepstones during the War of the Ninepenny Kings);</p>
<p>The Demon of Darry (legendary Lord Commander of the Kingsguard);</p>
<p>Ser Alyn Connington (the Pale Griffin, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard from the past).</p>
<p>Jaime is looking through the White Book, the history of the Kingsguard, updated throughout the ages by the Lord Commander. We learn much about Ser Barristan Selmy, who gained the title ‘the Bold' when he was just ten, riding as a mystery knight in a tourney at Blackhaven, where he was unmasked by the Prince of Dragonflies. Barristan was knighted at sixteen by King Aegon V, and named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year by Ser Gerold Hightower. The deeds and legends of Barristan the Bold are not lost on Jaime. He recalls the awesome fight between the Sword of the Morning and the Smiling Knight of the Kingswood Brotherhood, and thinks of his own childhood wishes: That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead.</p>
<p>Jaime then receives the five Kingsguard currently under his command, and tests each of them. He mocks Ser Boros for his cowardice and inability to protect Prince Tommen, and tells him that from here on in, Blount will taste all the King's food. Ser Boros storms from the room, and Jaime goes after Ser Osmund Kettleblack. Disgusted that a hedge knight with no reputation has been named to the Kingsguard, Jaime at least concedes that the man probably knows how to fight. He commands Ser Meryn to never again raise his hand against innocents, despite what the King demands. He gets Ser Balon to swear he will remain true to the Crown, even though his father and brother's allegiance are in question. Lastly, he questions Ser Loras, and finds the Knight of Flowers as cocky as he was when he was a younger man. Jaime confronts Loras about Brienne, and commands him to judge the woman fairly, on his honor as a knight. Considering Jaime's words about Renly's death, Ser Loras Tyrell nearly breaks down, stating, "When I saw him all bloody, with her fled...if she's innocent, then Robar and Emmon..." Jaime absolves him of killing the two Rainbow Guard in a rage, and then sits alone in the room, contemplating the other debts he still had to pay.</p>

<h2>Sansa (VI) {XX}   pg 762</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Kella (a shepherdess);</p>
<p>Bryen (captain of Littlefinger's household guard);</p>
<p>Grisel (once a wet nurse);</p>
<p>Umfred (steward of Littlefinger's keep).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Alayne Baelish* (Littlefinger's mother).</p>
<p>Sansa is alarmed to discover that Littlefinger has no intention of bringing her home; instead she is being taken to the Vale of Arryn. They land at the tiny village that Petyr is lord of, and he stresses that Sansa must use a new name, calling her Alayne Stone so that no one would know who she really was. She learns that Oswell is actually the Kettleblacks' father, and Littlefinger leads her to discern that it was the Queen of Thorns who poisoned Joffrey when she took one of the amethysts from the hair net. All the plans were arranged by Littlefinger, who had met Lady Olenna when he brokered the alliance that brought Highgarden to King's Landing. Soon after, Lysa Arryn arrives with a small retinue, and she and Petyr marry in his little village. Lysa wants to make another child with Petyr, after her father had aborted the first child years ago. Lysa does not like having Sansa around, although she does wish to marry her niece to Robert as soon as word reaches the Eyrie that Tyrion has been beheaded for treason.</p>

<h2>Jon (IX) {XXVI}   pg 778</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Tim Tangletongue (steward of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Ser Glendon Hewett (ranger from Eastwatch). </p>
<p>            The Watch prevents yet another wildling attack where Mance's raiders advanced under the protection of a giant, fortified turtle. Afterwards, Jon tries to get some sleep, but is pulled out of bed by some men from Eastwatch. They bring him before Ser Alliser Thorne, and his new friend Janos Slynt. The two accuse Jon of being a turncloak and oathbreaker, and they even use the captured Rattleshirt to support their accusations. Even Maester Aemon cannot persuade Lord Slynt to relent, and the former Commander of the City Watch has Jon thrown into an ice cell, relishing the thought of punishing one of Ned Stark's sons.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (X) {XXXIV}    pg 789</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Baelor Hightower (Baelor Brightsmile, heir of Lord Leyton, eldest brother or half-brother of Malora the Mad Maid, Lady Alerie Tyrell, Ser Garth Greysteel, Lynesse, and Ser Gunthor).</p>
<p>The last witness brought to testify against Tyrion is Shae, and it is obvious the Queen paid her well for the stories she tells the court. After her testimony, Tyrion again proclaims that he is innocent, and demands trial by combat. Prince Oberyn makes known his intention to champion the dwarf's cause. That evening, the Red Viper tells Tyrion more about his trip to Casterly Rock years before, and how his mother and Lady Joanna had planned to marry himself and Elia to Cersei and Jaime. Oberyn tells him that Lord Tywin ignored them the whole time, sending Ser Kevan to see to their needs, and he reveals how Cersei had tortured Tyrion as an infant. Years later, Oberyn learned why Tywin had refused his mother's marriage proposal: he intended to wed Cersei to Prince Rhaegar. But it was Oberyn's mother who won, because Elia married Rhaegar. And for that, Elia paid with her life at the command of Lord Tywin, who would never allow an insult to go unpunished. The Red Viper informs Tyrion that he will kill Gregor for what he did, but justice will not end there.</p>
<p>During the combat, Prince Oberyn dances around Gregor, tiring the huge knight. Relentlessly, the Red Viper tears into the Mountain, screaming his sister's name, and repeating, "You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children." Gregor, becoming frustrated, attempts to bull rush the Viper, but instead hacks an arm off a stableboy, and then beheads the innocent young man. When the sun rises, Oberyn uses his shield to blind the Mountain, and finds an exposure in the giant's armor. After stabbing his spear into the back of Gregor's knee, the Red Viper impales him to the ground, his spear through the Mountain's abdomen. Oberyn retrieves Gregor's greatsword, but before he can behead the man, the knight drags him to the ground, crushing Martell's face with his huge hands, while he admits raping and killing Elia. Tyrion falls to his knees in despair, realizing his fate is sealed.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (VI) {XXI}    pg 803</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ghael (envoy from Astapor).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Cleon (once a slave and butcher, now King Cleon the Great of Astapor, called King Cleaver);</p>
<p>King Jaehaerys II Targaryen* (father of King Aerys II and Queen Rhaella, grandfather of Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys, second son of King Aegon V, younger brother of Prince Duncan the Small, brother of Princess Rhaelle Baratheon, nephew of Maester Aemon).</p>
<p>Dany sits in the great pyramid of Meereen, her troops having conquered the city after the men she sent into the sewers opened the gates. She meets an envoy from Astapor, who represents King Cleon the great, a former butcher who now ruled Astapor, supposedly in Dany's name. But the envoy suggests that King Cleon wishes to marry Dany, and that the men she left to rule Astapor had all been deposed. Cleon has amassed new slaves, and is beginning to train them as Unsullied, and Dany is dismayed that all she had done to remove Astapor from slavery was coming undone.</p>
<p>Finally, she sends for Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan, hoping the two would have died in the sewers, but the two knights were greater warriors than even that suicide quest. Barristan speaks of things Dany was never aware of, that her father was mad, and that Viserys, even as a young boy, seemed to be more like his father than his brother Rhaegar. The old knight tells her, "The Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land." She absolves Barristan, and he swears his sword to her cause. But Ser Jorah does not beg forgiveness, and remains defensive that he had done nothing wrong. Dany then exiles the knight who was once her closest friend and protector, threatening to kill him if she ever sees him again.</p>
<p>Later, Daario warns her that she should not have banished Jorah, and that she may come to regret not keeping him near or having him killed outright. When her advisors urge her to move on, Dany decides that she must learn to rule if she ever wishes to sit the throne of Westeros, and she declares that she will stay in Meereen and rule as queen.</p>

<h2>Jaime (IX)   pg 818</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septa Donyse (a sister of the faith in King's Landing).</p>
<p>Ser Jaime is seated with the small council, as King Tommen signs all the papers brought before him by Ser Kevan. The Lannisters are granting Riverrun to Ser Emmon Frey and Kevan's sister Genna, once the Blackfish has surrendered. They legitimize Ramsay Snow and name Roose Bolton Warden of the North. Ser Rolph Spicer is granted Castamere, and raised to lord, and Lord Gawen Westerling, his wife, and daughter Jeyne are all granted a royal pardon, along with Lord Jonos Bracken, Lord Vance, Lord Goodbrook and Lord Mooton for entering King Tommen's service. Jaime had recently lost during a spar with Ser Addam Marbrand, and is disgusted that he cannot fight left-handed, especially after receiving the new Valyrian sword from his father.</p>
<p>Outside, he watches Steelshanks Walton and his men prepare to leave King's Landing, and sees a girl who claims to be Arya Stark. Jaime is pretty sure she is not the real Arya, yet she is to be presented to Ramsay at the Dreadfort. Ser Gregor's screams from Pycelle's solar can be heard throughout the Red Keep, for Lord Tywin has demanded that the Grand Maester heal him so that the King's Justice can kill him (rather than a poisoned spear). Jaime recalls his father mentioning that Stannis and his fleet have left Dragonstone, leaving only a token force to guard the island. Later, Cersei visits him in the White Sword Tower, and reveals that their father plans to send her back to Casterly Rock so that he will have a free hand in raising Tommen. During their conversation, Jaime puzzles out that it was Joffrey who sent the assassin to kill Bran, even though Cersei doesn't believe him when he tells her his suspicions. When she begins to unlace Jaime's breeches, he sends her off in anger.</p>
<p>He then has Brienne and Ser Loras brought before him, and the Knight of Flowers reveals that after speaking with the woman, he now believes she may be innocent. Ser Loras is dismissed, and Jaime reveals his belief that Tyrion is innocent, and that the Arya Stark sent north with Steelshanks was not the real Arya. Ser Jaime Lannister then commands Brienne to find and protect Lady Catelyn's daughters, as they had both pledged to do, and gives her the Valyrian sword he had so recently received from his father, saying, "A sword so fine must bear a name. It would please me if you would call this one ‘Oathkeeper'. Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor."</p>

<h2>Jon (X) {XXVII}   pg 830</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Munda (daughter of Tormund Giantsbane);</p>
<p>Torwynd the Tame (one of Tormund's sons).</p>
<p>Jon is brought once again before Janos Slynt, and told that only Maester Aemon is preventing Slynt from hanging Jon. Slynt reveals that he will give Jon one last chance to prove his innocence, sending him to meet Mance Rayder as an envoy, but Jon must kill the wildling king. Beyond the Wall, Jon meets Tormund who treats him with respect, almost as a friend. Jon is brought before Mance, and the king is aware that the Watch is nearly out of provisions and cannot hold out much longer.</p>
<p>Rayder then brings him to see the Horn of Winter, which Mance claims they found back in the Frostfangs, but only he and his trusted lieutenants knew about it. However, Mance does not wish to use the Horn, for if the songs can be believed, it will cause the Wall to collapse. The wildlings have come south not to conquer, but to escape the Others. Without the Wall, Mance's people would find no safe haven, even in the south, and that is something he does not wish to happen. Mance offers Jon the Horn of Winter if the Night's Watch will let his people pass the Wall and settle the lands to the south, although he will not abide the laws or taxes of the Seven Kingdoms. If the Watch refuses, Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Joramun in three days time. However, the parley is interrupted, as the wildlings have come under attack. Mance believes that it must be Cotter Pyke, but it is really King Stannis with all his mounted knights. During the battle, Harma Dogshead goes down, and Jon watches as the eagle that had once been Orell bursts into flames, and Varamyr runs screaming from the fray. Mance is surrounded and captured, and as Jon waits to see who commands the knights, Val calls him to Mance's tent, where Dalla is giving birth.</p>

<h2>Arya (XIII) {XXVIII}    pg 843</h2></p>
<p>Arya and Sandor have arrived at an inn, where they find Polliver and the Tickler. They learn that Joffrey is dead, and much else that has been transpiring in the south. Gregor's two men are congenial at first, but have no intention of letting Sandor go, planning instead to drag him before the Mountain. The Tickler throws a dagger at the Hound's head, but he dodges it, and then steel is drawn. Arya watches as the two men begin to hammer at Sandor, the Hound too drunk to fight well enough even to defend himself. The young squire with Polliver and the Tickler grabs Arya's arm, but she stabs him with his own dagger. The Hound, now bleeding from a dozen wounds, cleaves Polliver near in two, and as the Tickler backs away, Arya drives her blade through the interrogator's back, screaming, "Is there gold in the village? Is there silver? Gems? Where is Lord Beric? How many men were with him?" She continues to stab him, until Clegane pulls her off the dead man. Retrieving Needle from Polliver's corpse, the two leave the inn.</p>
<p>But Sandor is dying from his wounds, and he is running a terrible fever. Arya pours boiling wine over his wounds, and helps dress the worst of them, but realizes that the Hound may not make it. For a moment, Arya plans to kill Sandor, but leaves him to die under a tree. Making for Saltpans, Arya hopes to find a ship to take her to Eastwatch, where she may be able to reunite with Jon. She sells her horse, but when she tries to buy passage to Eastwatch aboard a ship from the Free City of Braavos, the captain laughs at the small amount she offers. Almost defeated, Arya shows him the iron coin Jaqen H'ghar had given her, and speaks the words valar morghulis. The captain responds, "Valar dohaeris. Of course you shall have a cabin."</p>

<h2>Samwell (IV)   pg 855</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Denys Mallister (commander of the Shadow Tower, uncle of Lord Jason Mallister);</p>
<p>Cotter Pyke (commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea);</p>
<p>Hop-Robin (recruit of the Watch).</p>
<p>At Castle Black, Gilly is nursing both her own son as well as Mance Rayder's, as Dalla died giving birth. Sam and Gilly had recently returned to Castle Black, meeting up with Ser Denys Mallister and the men from the Shadow Tower. They also joined with Dywen, Edd and Giant- the survivors from the Bridge of Skulls where Bowen Marsh had held back the wildlings advance, killing the Weeper during the battle. Sam is happy to be reunited with Jon, although he is wary of King Stannis' army being present at Castle Black. It was the King who had defeated the wildlings, scattering their remnants back into the Haunted Forest. Val wants to bring her sister's baby to Mance, but Jon tells her that only Maester Aemon is permitted to see the imprisoned wildling king. Alone, Sam asks Jon, "Could there be honor in a lie, if it were told for a good purpose?" Sam is considering sending Gilly and her son to Horn Hill, with a letter that he had fathered the boy.</p>
<p>Jon reveals that Slynt still considers him a traitor, because he did not kill Mance as he was sent to do. Sam remembers swearing to Bran and Jojen Reed not to reveal to anyone, even Jon, that Bran was still alive. And Coldhands' last words to Sam were, "Let the world believe the boy is dead. We want no seekers coming after us. Swear it, Samwell of the Night's Watch. Swear it for the life you owe me." And Sam kept his vows to all three. Later, Sam considers the last vote for a new Lord Commander, with Ser Denys Mallister still leading, but no one near the majority. At dinner, Bowen Marsh withdraws his name from the voting, and backs Janos Slynt. When the votes are tallied that night, both Ser Denys and Cotter Pyke had lost votes, and Slynt had gained on both of them. Sitting with Grenn, Pyp and Dolorous Edd, Pyp suggests that if Sam were to persuade either Ser Denys or Cotter Pyke to set aside their quarrels and back the other, a new Lord Commander could be decided. Preferably one who would be beneficial to the Watch, so long as it was not Janos Slynt.</p>

<h2>Jon (XI) {XXVIII}   pg 864</h2></p>
<p>Jon is training with Satin in the yard, when Melisandre arrives to take him before Stannis. The King does not believe Jon is a traitor, for he knew Janos Slynt as well as Ned Stark. Stannis knew Ned to be a man of honor, and trusts Jon- saying it was Jon who found the dragonglass dagger that Sam Tarly used to kill the Other, and Jon who brought them the Horn of Winter and captured Mance's son (all of which, Jon thinks to himself, he had nothing to do with directly). Stannis asks Jon if there is honor in Mance Rayder, and the young man responds, "Yes." The King speaks of the war that Melisandre has seen in her flames, and he confides that Jon may have a part in the upcoming battle. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and name him Lord of Winterfell, especially with all the strife occurring in the North. Stannis intends to let the wildlings through the Wall, and settle them in the Gift, should they pledge fealty and accept the Lord of Light as their god. He also presumes to marry his loyal Lord of Winterfell to Val to solidify his peace with the wildlings. Jon asks for time to consider the offer, and Stannis agrees.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (XI) {XXXV}    pg 871</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Red Lester, Lum (Lannister guardsmen).</p>
<p>Tyrion, locked in the black cells beneath the Red Keep, is rescued by Jaime. His brother tells him that he is to be beheaded on the morrow, and informs him that he coerced Varys into helping him charter a ship to take Tyrion from King's Landing. When Jaime tells him that the rescue was a debt he owed him, Tyrion presses his brother, and learns that Tysha was not a whore, but a crofter's daughter, just as she appeared. Lord Tywin had forced Jaime all those years ago to lie about Tysha so as to teach Tyrion a lesson. Tyrion is infuriated that his brother never told him the truth, and punches Jaime in the face. Tyrion warns him that he will exact revenge against him, their father, and Cersei, as a Lannister always pays his debts. Jaime then asks if Tyrion poisoned Joff, and the dwarf admits to doing so, but also reveals that Cersei is sleeping with Lancel and Ser Osmund and perhaps others, and that Joffrey would have been a monster if he remained king.</p>
<p>Tyrion stalks off without a further word, and confronts Varys for his betrayal. The eunuch concedes that he cannot find a trace of Sansa, then leads him deeper down, to the fourth level where Maegor had built torture chambers. When they come to a circular tower chamber with a ladder leading up, Tyrion realizes it leads up to the Tower of the Hand. Commanding Varys to wait for him, Tyrion ascends the wickedly high ladder. It leads to a secret passage behind the rooms in the Tower, perfect for Varys' "little birds" to overhear everything going on in the Hand's quarters. He opens the secret door to his old chamber, and finds Shae naked in his father's bed, with the Hand's chain of office around her neck. The whore pleads that the Queen made her say all those things against him in court, but Tyrion strangles her with the chain he once wore. Grabbing a crossbow off the wall, he finds his father in the privy. Tywin commands him to put down the crossbow, promising that he had no intention of carrying out the sentence, and would allow Tyrion to take the black. Disbelieving his father, Tyrion questions him as to what became of Tysha. Lord Tywin reveals he did not have her killed, but knew nothing of what had become of "the whore". Tyrion fires the bolt into his father's abdomen, killing Lord Tywin...</p>

<h2>Samwell (V)   pg 881</h2></p>
<p>King Stannis has brought several of the black brothers before him to make known his ire that they were taking too long to select a new Lord Commander. Stannis sees through Janos Slynt's fawning, having known the man was a bribe-taker in King's Landing. The king makes it clear that after they finally vote in a new Lord Commander, he plans to take all the castles along the Wall, except for the three currently occupied by the Watch, to garrison his forces. He also plans to either take or be granted the Gift, stating that he intends to help the Watch guard the Wall. He commands the builders to deliver reports on the conditions of the abandoned castles, and informs the men gathered that nightfires will be lit before the gates of all the castles. When Melisandre mentions the impending war, Maester Aemon is aware that she speaks of the prophesied War for the Dawn. After the others have left, Aemon asks to see the fabled sword Lightbringer through Sam's eyes. Sam describes the sword as glowing, yet there are no flames.</p>
<p>Stannis questions Sam about dragonglass, making it known that there are great deposits of obsidian beneath Dragonstone, and that he intends to have it mined and brought to the Wall. The king asks Sam to show him the Black Gate, as he intends to make the Nightfort his seat, and Sam agrees although he is not sure if the gate will open for a man not of the black. When they leave, Maester Aemon asks Sam if he felt any heat emanating from the sword, and he realizes that he had not. Aemon speaks of the choosing; subtlely inferring that Sam could do something to help speed the process. Determined to put aside the bickering between the two leading candidates, Sam speaks with both Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister individually, asking them if they would step aside if the right candidate were to be named. Playing one off the other, using their dislike for each other, Sam sets it up so that each man would lend his support to Jon that night.</p>

<h2>Jon (XII) {XXIX}   pg 891</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Iron Emmett (ranger from Eastwatch).</p>
<p>After sparring in the yard, Jon goes to the bathhouse, and overhears Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh mentioning that Lord Tywin sent a letter backing Janos Slynt's rise to Lord Commander. They show it to Othell Yarwyck, seeking to have the First Builder withdraw and back Slynt. Jon is disturbed by the prospect of Slynt becoming Lord Commander, and goes off through the gate beyond the Wall. He is torn between his duties to the Watch, and the chance Stannis has given him to become Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. As he is considering that he has always wanted this, his thoughts change to a hunger for food. When he looks up, Ghost comes padding over, and Jon looks at the direwolf's red eyes.</p>
<p>Recalling what Melisandre said about there being no old gods, only the Lord of Light and the Other, Jon realizes, red eyes, but not like Melisandre's. He had a weirwood's eyes. He belongs to the old gods, this one. His mind made up, he attends the voting council for the first time. He is greeted with shouts of disapproval from Slynt and Thorne, learning that his name has been put forth as Lord Commander. Seeking to end the voting, Ser Alliser mentions that Othell Yarwyck has something to say, but the First Builder abandons their plotting, and withdraws in favor of Jon. When Sam and Clydas go to fetch the voting kettle, a large raven flies out and lands on Jon's shoulder, cawing, "Snow. Snow." The Black Brothers are amazed when they realize the bird is Mormont's raven. Jon Snow wins the vote and is named Lord Commander, but he must soon confront Stannis with the news...</p>

<h2>Sansa (VII) {XXI}   pg 900</h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Myranda Royce (Randa, daughter of Lord Nestor Royce, a widow).</p>
<p>At the Eyrie, Sansa awakens to find it snowing outside. She wanders outside and begins to sculpt a snow castle, slowly forming it into a replica of Winterfell. Littlefinger finds her in the garden and helps her finish the castle. He tells her she is even more beautiful than her mother was at her age, and then proceeds to kiss her. Sansa is shocked by Lord Baelish's action, but young Robert approaches and destroys the snow castle with his ragged doll. Sansa reacts by tearing the doll in half, causing her cousin to begin shaking violently. Maester Colemon is called to bring the boy for a leeching, in an attempt to cure the fit. Sansa is brought before her aunt, but Lysa is not concerned about her son's seizure, but rather Sansa kissing Petyr. Lysa accuses her of trying to seduce her husband, just like her mother had tried to "steal" Petyr from her.</p>
<p>Lady Arryn then relates the story of how one night when they had all gotten drunk, Catelyn spurned Littlefinger, and Lysa had gone to his bed afterward to comfort him, even though he had called her Cat. Lysa continues to rant about how her father took their baby away from them, and then grabs Sansa and drags her before the Moon Door while calling for Marillion. Lysa pushes her closer and closer to the edge, until Littlefinger arrives and tells his new wife to release her. Lysa, bordering on insanity, reveals how she had persuaded Jon Arryn to get Littlefinger his first post, and how she had done as he said when Petyr told her to put the Tears of Lys in her husband's wine. He also had her write the letter to her sister falsely naming the Lannisters as Jon Arryn's murderers. Petyr promises never to leave her side again, and as she falls into his arms, he tells her he has only ever loved one woman, Cat- and then shoves her out the Moon Door. Littlefinger calls for the guards, accusing Marillion of killing his wife...</p>

<h2>Epilogue (Point-of-View: Merrett Frey)   pg 915</h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Kyra Goodbrook (of House Frey, daughter of Ser Jared Frey, wife of the late Ser Garse);</p>
<p>Ser Garse Goodbrook* (husband of Kyra, slain during the Red Wedding);</p>
<p>Ser Tytos Frey* (only son of Ser Jared Frey, brother of Kyra, killed by Sandor Clegane at the great pavilions during the Red Wedding).</p>
<p>Merrett Frey is approaching the ruins of Oldstones with the ransom for his half-brother's (Ser Stevron's) grandson Petyr Pimple. He is considering all the ill luck throughout his life, starting with his captivity in the Kingswood as a squire, and how a pox he caught before the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood left him unable to reach knighthood. His father had always mocked him as "Merrett Muttonhead", and all he was good for during the Red Wedding was to drink the Greatjon under the table. Merrett recollects how his father had ordered the massacre of the Starks at Edmure's wedding, but it had been Lame Lothar and Roose Bolton who had masterminded the whole affair. He considers how things at the Twins will turn even worse when his father dies, as Ser Ryman stands to inherit, and his sons Edwyn and Black Walder after him. Merrett felt that if he could accomplish this task, maybe his luck would change for the better, considering that Petyr was Ser Ryman's son. However, he failed at everything in his life, including his role in keeping the Greatjon too drunk to fight. The man had killed or maimed four men, and it took eight to finally get him in chains.</p>
<p>When he reaches the site of King Tristifer's sepulcher, he finds the outlaws who had captured Petyr. They surround him and take the gold he carried for the ransom.
