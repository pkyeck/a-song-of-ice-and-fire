<h2>Prologue (Point-of-View: Pate)</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mollander (novice of the Citadel born with a clubfoot, called Hopfrog; his father was a knight killed during the Battle of the Blackwater);</p>
<p>Alleras (called the Sphinx, an acolyte of three links and an accomplished bowman; half Dornish and half Summer Islander);</p>
<p>Roone (a young novice);</p>
<p>Emma (serving wench at the Quill and Tankard);</p>
<p>Rosey (Emma's 15 year old daughter);</p>
<p>Pate* (a novice in service to Archmaester Walgrave; 5 years a novice and has yet to forge a link in his maester's collar; killed by the Alchemist);</p>
<p>Armen (called the Acolyte, an acolyte of four links);</p>
<p>Archmaester Ebrose (Archmaester of the Citadel in Oldtown, the Healer; his ring, rod and mask made of silver);</p>
<p>Archmaester Walgrave (ancient Archmaester in name only now; an expert on ravens; his ring, rod and mask are made of black iron; possibly trained Maester Cressen);</p>
<p>Maester Gormon (of house Tyrell; maester of the Citadel who often serves in Walgrave's place; uncle of Lord Mace Tyrell, brother of Garth the Gross and Ser Moryn);</p>
<p>The Alchemist (mysterious stranger seeking access to the Citadel; his description virtually identical to Jaqen H'ghar's changed appearance when he leaves Arya);</p>
<p>Leo Tyrell (called Lazy Leo, novice of the Citadel, son of Ser Moryn Tyrell, cousin of Lord Mace, nephew of Garth the Gross and Maester Gormon, great-uncle of Elinor Tyrell);</p>
<p>Archmaester Vaellyn (called Vinegar Vaellyn, the Stargazer, his ring, rod and mask forged of bronze);</p>
<p>Archmaester Perestan (the Historian, his ring, rod and mask made of copper);</p>
<p>Archmaester Ryam (his ring, rod and mask made of yellow gold);</p>
<p>Archmaester Mollos, Archmaester Benedict (Archmaesters of the Citadel).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Moryn Tyrell (uncle of Lord Mace Tyrell, Lady Mina Redwyne, and Lady Janna Fossoway; Commander of the City Watch of Oldtown, father of Lazy Leo, good-brother of the Queen of Thorns).</p>
<p>Legends: Spotted Pate the Pig Boy (mythological simpleton who always bested some lord, knight or septon in the songs).</p>
<p>Several novices and a pair of acolytes from the Citadel in Oldtown are discussing the possible reappearance of dragons while drinking at the Quill and Tankard. The novice Pate is thinking about Rosey, a 15 year old girl whose mother is selling her maidenhead for one gold dragon. Pate hopes to soon buy her and then leave the Citadel and wander the world with the girl. Pate is hoping the Alchemist, a mysterious stranger, will return to the inn in 3 days with a gold dragon for Pate. While the others continue to discuss dragons, Armen declares there are no more; but Alleras the Sphinx mentions that Daenerys may still be alive and could be the source of all these tales of dragons across the sea. Soon after, Lazy Leo arrives and begins picking on the others as is his wont. Leo tells them that the tales are true, that Daenerys has hatched three dragons, and that Archmaester Marwyn believes the stories. Marwyn the Mage has a somewhat unsavory reputation due to his dabbling in sorcery and the dark arts, but he still has a group of supporters at the Citadel.</p>
<p>Leo presents proof by stating that a glass candle is burning in Marwyn's tower, something that Armen finds unbelievable as obsidian candles cannot burn. The Citadel has been using them for years as one of the final lessons a maester must learn on the importance of being humble and knowing the limitations and dangers of knowledge. But Leo swears he saw the candle himself, and Alleras imparts that if a dragonglass candle burns, then surely dragons are returned to the world. The others soon depart for bed, but Pate remains with Leo who mocks him and his affection for Rosey. Pate would like nothing better than to hit Leo, but he is well  aware of Leo's heritage. Pate then takes his leave, and on the way back to his quarters bumps into the Alchemist. With some misgivings, Pate turns over the black iron key to the Citadel that he stole from Archmaester Walgrave's lockbox for his reward. Pate gets a look at the stranger, noting that he had a very ordinary face with a hooked nose and a scar on his right cheek (just as Jaqen H'ghar looked after he transformed). As Pate walks off with his gold dragon, he begins to feel faint and then collapses on the cobblestones dead. His last words are, "What's happening? I don't understand."; to which the Alchemist responds sadly, "And never will."

<h2>	The Prophet (PoV: Aeron Greyjoy)   pg 17        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Emmond (a boy recently drowned by Aeron, now a member of the priest's drowned men);</p>
<p>Norjen, Rus (two of Aeron's drowned men);</p>
<p>Tarle the Thrice-Drowned (a priest of the Drowned God, once picked to crown a king);</p>
<p>The Sparr (a minor lord on Great Wyk, father of Steffarion);</p>
<p>Steffarion Sparr (son and heir of the Sparr);</p>
<p>Lord Gorold Goodbrother (Lord of the Hammerhorn on Great Wyk, father of Greydon, Gran, Gormond, Gysella, and Gwin);</p>
<p>Greydon, Gran and Gormond Goodbrother (triplet sons of Lord Gorold);</p>
<p>Gysella and Gwin Goodbrother (daughters of Lord Gorold);</p>
<p>Maester Murenmure (counselor and maester at Hammerhorn);</p>
<p>Lord Meldred Merlyn (Lord of Pebbleton on Great Wyk).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Quellon Greyjoy* (Lord of the Iron Islands, fathered 9 sons on three wives, succeeded as Lord of the Iron Islands by his 4th son Balon; father of Harlon, Quenton, Donel, Balon, Euron Crow's Eye, Victarion, Urrigon, Aeron Damphair, and Robin);</p>
<p>Urrigon Greyjoy* (Urri, fourth son of Lord Quellon and his second wife, younger brother of Balon, Euron and Victarion, older brother of Aeron; died from an infected wound inflicted by Aeron while playing the finger dance);</p>
<p>Harlon*, Quenton* and Donel Greyjoy* (sons of Lord Quellon with his first wife, all died in their youth);</p>
<p>Robin Greyjoy* (9th son of Lord Quellon, and only progeny of his 3rd wife, a woman from the "green lands" [Pinkmaiden, specifically]; "the brother best forgotten");</p>
<p>Lord Sawane Botley* (Lord of Lordsport on Pyke, drowned by Euron Crow's Eye, father of Harren and Tristifer, brother of the recently-named Lord Germund; drowned by the Crow's Eye for naming Theon heir).</p>
<p>Legends: The Grey King (legendary High King of the Iron Islands and beyond, said to rule the sea itself and married a mermaid; the Greyjoys claim descent from him; his hall was said to be Nagga's bones themselves, and he ruled for 1007 years);</p>
<p>Urras Ironfoot, Sylas Flatnose, Harrag Hoare, and The Old Kraken (all High Kings of the Iron Islands chosen by a kingsmoot thousands of years ago).</p>
<p>Aeron Greyjoy is drowning men on Great Wyk when The Sparr and a son of Lord Goodbrother come to him with news of King Balon's death. Losing one of the two pillars he had built his current life on, the Damphair does not easily suffer these lesser lords who demand that he follow them to Lord Goodbrother's keep. Believing the Storm God claimed his eldest brother's life, Aeron takes Gormond's horse and heads to Hammerhorn. On the way, he reflects on his brothers and half-brothers, most of whom did not live past childhood. Balon himself had never shown anything but scorn for Aeron, but his earlier life was scornful as well as sinful. At Hammerhorn, Aeron demands that Lord Gorold send off his daughters and maester, but Maester Murenmure mentions that Euron Crow's Eye sits the Seastone Chair. Infuriated that the godless Euron should call all the other captains to bend their knee to him, Damphair is determined to prevent his crowning; or that of Asha as Balon wanted, since the priest believes that "no woman will ever rule the ironborn".</p>
<p>Aeron learns that Euron drowned Lord Sawane Botley for declaring Theon the rightful heir, and when the maester echoes Botley's sentiment, Damphair responds, "Too long have the ironborn listened to you chain-neck maesters... It is time we listened to the sea again." On his way to Pebbleton, Aeron falls asleep in the saddle and dreams of his brother Urrigon, who lost half his hand from an axe thrown by Aeron. Lord Quellon's third wife sent for her maester to heal him, but the wound festered and Urri died. Lord Quellon died reaving, but when Balon returned as the new Lord of the ironborn, he hacked off three of the maester's fingers and commanded his stepmother to try and heal him. Aeron also recalls in the dream how he had drank and boasted as a young man, yet his ship was sunk by Lord Stannis Baratheon's Fury during Balon's rebellion, and he had drowned. Linked to this frequent dream is the sound of a rusted door creaking open, and Euron entering...</p>
<p>Convinced that Victarion must sit the Seastone Chair, Aeron gathers followers on his way to the seashore preaching that a new king will rise. Entering the ice cold sea at night, Aeron has a revelation that there must be a kingsmoot beneath Nagga's bones on Old Wyk, as had been the Old Way millenia ago. In the morning, Aeron dismisses Lord Merlyn's message that the Reader is summoning the ironborn to the Ten Towers to pay homage to Asha. He then tells his gathering to go to Old Wyk, declaring, "We shall have no king but from the kingsmoot". 
<h2>	The Captain of Guards (PoV: Areo Hotah)    pg 30        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Areo Hotah (Captain of Prince Doran Martell's household guards, born in Norvos and trained to fight with a longaxe by the bearded priests; fiercely loyal to Prince Doran and his daughter Arianne);</p>
<p>Prince Doran Nymeros Martell (Prince of Dorne, Lord of Sunspear, elder brother of the late Princess Elia Targaryen and Prince Oberyn, brother-in-law by marriage to the late Prince Rhaegar, father of Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane, ward of Princess Myrcella; suffering terribly from gout);</p>
<p>Obara Sand (eldest of the Sand Snakes [the Red Viper's bastard daughters], her mother was a whore from Oldtown);</p>
<p>Maester Calleote (counselor and maester to Prince Doran at the Water Gardens);</p>
<p>Nymeria Sand (Lady Nym, second oldest of the Sand Snakes, her mother a noblewoman from Old Volantis);</p>
<p>Maester Myles (counselor and healer at Sunspear);</p>
<p>Ricasso (seneschal at Sunspear);</p>
<p>Ser Manfrey Martell (castellan of Sunspear, cousin of Prince Doran);</p>
<p>Princess Arianne Martell (eldest child and heir of Prince Doran, once promised to Prince Viserys; cousin of the Sand Snakes, sister of Quentyn and Trystane, niece of Prince Oberyn and Princess Elia; takes Ser Arys Oakheart as her lover; plots to crown Myrcella Queen of the Seven Kingdoms);</p>
<p>Tyene Sand (third eldest of the Sand Snakes, her mother a septa; closest of all the Sand Snakes to Arianne).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lady Mellario Martell (of the Free City of Norvos, Prince Doran's wife, mother of Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane; currently returned to Norvos for an extended stay);</p>
<p>Sarella Sand (4th of the Sand Snakes, her mother a trader; captain of her own ship at age nineteen);</p>
<p>Mors* and Olyvar Martell* (younger brothers of Prince Doran who died in infancy before Elia was born).</p>
<p>Legends:Queen Myriah Targaryen (of House Martell, wife of Good King Daeron, their marriage brought Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms; mother of Baelor Breakspear, Aerys, Aelinor, Rhaegel and Maekar; grandmother of Maester Aemon and Egg).</p>
<p>Prince Doran has been at the Water Gardens for nearly two years now, watching the children play in the pools while trying to deal with his gout. Captain Hotah hears the approach of Obara Sand, eldest of the Red Viper's bastard daughters, and bars her from disturbing Prince Doran's rest. Deadly as she may be, she is no match for the Captain, but the Prince calls her into his presence before they come to blows. Obara demands justice for her father, imploring Prince Doran to marshall the Dornish army and give half to her so she might march on Oldtown and burn it to the ground, and the other half to her half-sister Lady Nym to march up the Kingsroad. Doran tells her that his brother was not murdered, but died in single combat, and that Lord Tywin has promised them Ser Gregor's head. Unappeased, Obara mocks her uncle for his meekness and stalks off after he tells her to await his word in Sunspear. Fearing an uprising in Sunspear incited by the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran tells Hotah that he must return to his seat at the Palace of the Sun.</p>
<p>The Captain reminds him that Princess Myrcella is there, and that Ser Arys Oakheart sends letters to Queen Cersei. Hotah thinks that he and the Kingsguard will eventually cross swords, and when that occurs the Captain would kill him. The next morning, the Prince and his retinue begin the journey back to Sunspear, but along the way they come upon another of the Sand Snakes. The beautiful Lady Nym is far more tactful than her older half-sister, but no less resolved to seek vengeance for her father. Scoffing at Obara's demand to go to war, Lady Nym tells her uncle that she needs only her sister Tyene, and the two will assassinate Cersei, Jaime, Lord Tywin and King Tommen. Stating that his brother was only to take the measure of Joffrey's court and not seek revenge for Elia despite the 17 years that had passed, Nymeria responds in parting, "My sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our vengeance."</p>
<p>Arriving in Sunspear, the Prince's retinue is accosted by townspeople calling for vengeance for the Red Viper. In the Old Palace, Princess Arianne greets her father and tells him that Tyene Sand awaits him in the throne room. The third of the Sand Snakes is embroidering when the Captain encounters her while bearing Prince Doran to his high seat. Tyene offers her uncle the cloth she was knitting, which showed her father mounted on a sand steed, so that he would not forget the Red Viper. Prince Doran responds, "I am not like to forget your father." Tyene counsels her uncle to wed his son Trystane to Myrcella now, and then crown the princess as is the Dornish way. This would incite the Queen Regent and Highgarden to march on Dorne, where the Prince's armies could bleed them in the high passes and treacherous deserts. When she calls her uncle fearful, Doran advises her, "There is a difference between fear and caution." Tyene raises her hand to touch her uncle, but Hotah brings the butt of his longaxe down on the marble floor, and cautions her, "My lady, you presume. Step from the dais, if it please you." The Sand Snake replies, "I meant no harm, Captain. I love my uncle, as I know he loved my father." After she takes her leave, Maester Caleotte rushes to the Prince's side to make sure he wasn't pricked by one of Tyene's needles.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Prince Doran commands the Captain to round up and confine all the Sand Snakes, including Ellaria's young daughters, in the cells at the top of the Spear Tower, but with no blood spilled. When Hotah tells him that the common folk will howl when they find out, the Prince of Dorne replies, "All Dorne will howl. I only pray Lord Tywin hears them...so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear." 
<h2>	Cersei (I)   pg 46        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Senelle* (one of Cersei's bedmaids, later given to Qyburn for his "experiments");</p>
<p>Jocelyn Swyft (companion of Cersei, referred to as Lady Jocelyn in the appendix?);</p>
<p>Shortear, Puckens (Lannister guardsman of the Hand);</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Rugen (undergaoler of the black cells, missing with Tyrion; most likely one of Varys' disguises).</p>
<p>Cersei is dreaming that she sat upon the Iron Throne, but the dream turns to nightmare as Tyrion ridicules her, and the barbed swords of the Throne begin to cut her. She is awoken by her maids and two Kingsguard who bear the news of Lord Tywin's murder. Cersei, still reeling from her nightmare and thoughts of the valonqar (little brother), finally realizes what they are saying. She learns that a hidden passage was found in the Hand's room, and that Jaime went to find out where it leads. The Queen Regent sends Ser Boros to check if Tyrion is still in his cell, while she contemplates the Tyrells' ambitions. Reaching the Tower of the Hand, Cersei is now brooding on how she was the only true "son" her father had, and how she will become even greater than Lord Tywin.</p>
<p>She sends away all the extraneous bystanders and commands Pycelle be brought in to remove the crossbow bolt from her father's abdomen. But Pycelle had already come and went, which further infuriates Cersei as she considers how useless the Grand Maester has become. However, Qyburn arrives and offers to remove the quarrel and ready the Hand for the wake. Qyburn also asks about the girl, Shae, whose body Cersei had not noticed. Recalling how Lord Tywin had dealt with one of his father's mistresses when he caught her wearing his mother's jewels, Cersei refuses to believe that Shae was in his bed as a whore. She commands Ser Osmund to dump Shae's body and to squelch any mention that she was even in the room. </p>
<p>Shortly after, Jaime returns from his search, claiming it was fruitless as the secret passages were too numerous. Cersei demands that workers be brought in to start dismantling the walls, and then she asks Jaime to be Tommen's Hand. When he refuses, Cersei tells him that she would rule, to which her twin responds, "I don't know who I pity more: Tommen, or the Seven Kingdoms." The queen reacts by slapping him, but her action infuriates their uncle Kevan, who had been at Tywin's side since Cersei arrived. As Cersei considers that her choice for Hand should be someone trustworthy and meek, she realizes that Varys is no where to be found. Commanding Ser Meryn to find the master of whisperers, Ser Boros returns with word that Tyrion had escaped from his cell...

<h2>	Brienne (I)   pg 56        </h2>
	<u>Introduced:</u> Ser Creighton Longbough (a hedge knight who claims brave deeds during the Battle of the Blackwater);</p>
<p>Ser Illifer the Penniless (Illy, a hedge knight and companion of Ser Creighton);</p>
<p>Naggle (innkeep at the Old Stone Bridge);</p>
<p>Hibald (a merchant on the road to Duskendale);</p>
<p>Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen (called the Mad Mouse, a hedge knight in service to Hibald and later in service to Littlefinger).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Herbert Bolling* (a knight supposedly killed by Ser Creighton).</p>
<p>Legends: Ser Galladon of Morne (The Perfect Knight, a legendary knight who bore the enchanted sword 'The Just Maid');</p>
<p>Lord Lucas Lothston (the Pander, last of the Lords of Harrenhal from house Lothston, a family that was overthrown for some black deeds; Harrenhal then passed into the care of the Whents);</p>
<p>Manfryd Lothston (Manfryd o' the Black Hood, son of Lord Lucas; possibly the same Manfred Lothston mentioned in TSS as having first supported, and then betrayed Prince Daemon Blackfyre).</p>
<p>Brienne is traveling to Duskendale, seeking the whereabouts of Sansa as she was charged to do by Ser Jaime. Having found few leads in King's Landing, Brienne is asking nearly everyone she can along the roads and villages, but never mentions Sansa by name. Upon the road beyond Rosby, she comes upon a camp with two hedge knights who offer to share their meal. Mistaking her at first for a man, Ser Illifer later remarks on how she bears a shield with the sigil of house Lothston, a disgraced family who once held Harrenhal. Brienne was given the shield by Ser Jaime, who had taken it from Harrenhal. When she tells the two that she lost her own shield, Ser Illifer figures out by her size that she must be Brienne, murderess of King Renly. The Maid denies having killed Renly, and the hedge knights agree to travel with her to Duskendale.</p>
<p>After passing a large group of poor fellows (or 'sparrows'), lowly holy men bound for King's Landing bearing the bones of septons killed around the Riverlands, they catch up to a merchant guarded by a couple of men and another hedge knight named Ser Shadrich. Joining forces along the dangerous road, Ser Shadrich tells Brienne in private that he knows that the maid she seeks is Sansa Stark, and that he seeks her as well, but for a purse of gold offered by Lord Varys. Brienne is disturbed by the fact that the Mad Mouse knew whom she was speaking of when she repeated Sansa's description to the merchant's group. When the party stops at an inn for the night, Brienne slips off on her own, swearing to herself that she will not fail Jaime, having already failed King Renly and Lady Catelyn.

<h2>	Samwell (I) {VI}   pg 71        </h2>
	<u>Introduced:</u> Left Hand Lew (a steward of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>Legends: Orbert Caswell (called the Black Centaur, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch perhaps centuries ago);</p>
<p>Septon Jorquen (author of Annals of the Black Centaur, a septon of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Colloquo Votar (Volantene adventurer who penned The Jade Compendium, describing myths and tales of the East from around the Jade Sea);</p>
<p>Maester Thomax (author of Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apothoesis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons);</p>
<p>Osric Stark (boy Lord Commander of the Watch 400 years before the Conquest).</p>
<p>Down in the library beneath Castle Black, Sam is trying to dig up any information on the Others for his Lord Commander, Jon Snow. Returning to the surface, Sam considers how hard Jon has been working the men of the Watch. Meeting up with Dolorous Edd, Pyp and Grenn, they mention how much Jon has changed, acting different and barely spending any time with his friends; although he never misses a day practicing his swordwork. We learn that Stannis has plans for Val, Dalla's sister, seeking to use her in order to forge an alliance between the wildlings and the northmen, although so far only the Karstarks have agreed to ally with Stannis. Arriving at Jon's solar, the Lord Commander shows him a letter he plans to send to King Tommen which declares that Stannis is aiding them in their battle, but the Night's Watch is not sworn to his cause.</p>
<p> Discussing how Melisandre means to sacrifice Mance Rayder for his king's blood, Jon states, "Mance's blood is no more royal than mine own." He reveals to Sam that he is sending Gilly and "the boy" far away from the Wall. Sam tells Jon that he has uncovered little on the Others, but one book mentioned dragonsteel swords as being effective against them. However, neither is sure if dragonsteel and Valyrian steel are the same thing. Jon breaks the news that he is sending Sam to the Citadel so he can train to become a maester and replace Aemon. Sam will travel by sea from Eastwatch, along with Gilly, the baby, and Maester Aemon. </p>
<p>The thought of becoming a maester frightens Sam, bringing back memories of his father's wrath when he had mentioned training at the Citadel to Lord Randyll when he was a boy. His father had chained him by the neck in a cell and left him there for 3 days, telling him "no son of House Tarly will ever wear a chain". Lastly, Jon commands Sam to never call himself craven again. The next morning, as the party prepares to set off for Eastwatch where they will join up with Dareon, Gilly begs Jon to find a good wetnurse for the other baby...

<h2>	Arya (I) {XXIX}   pg 87        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ternesio Terys (merchant-captain of the Titan's Daughter);</p>
<p>Yorko and Denyo Terys (sons of Ternesio who work aboard his merchanter);</p>
<p>The Kindly Man (a servant/priest of the Many-Faced God in the House of Black and White, probably a teacher of the Faceless Men);</p>
<p>The Waif (appears as a young girl but is much older, another servant of the Many-Faced God).</p>
<p>Nearing Braavos, Arya recalls how she originally wanted Captain Ternesio to sail for the Wall, but the free city would be a good place to land, considering that Syrio had come from Braavos and possibly Jaqen as well. During the voyage, many of the sailors and even the captain had asked her to learn and remember their names, and many seemed afraid of her. The captain's younger son Denyo is telling Arya some of the history of Braavos and the Titan that guards its port. The free city honored all gods and even had temples devoted to them, and was founded by the Moonsingers when they brought the people to Braavos to escape the dragons of Valyria. The Titan of Braavos is a massive statue, and has arrow slits and murder holes strategically placed to attack any boat that tried to pass beneath without leave. Furthermore, the Free City of Braavos was protected by the Arsenal, a massive fleet of ships and their fortified port.</p>
<p>The captain has his older son Yorko row Arya to shore, so as to get her off prior to customs coming aboard. As Yorko navigates the hundred isles of Braavos, he points out many of the sites, before dropping her off at the quay in front of the House of Black and White. Arya disembarks, assuring Yorko that she would remember his name, and enters the temple of the Many-Faced God. Within, the temple is quite dark with dozens of odd statues, and Arya notices several people in alcoves who are either dead or dying. Soon, a robed man with a kind voice tells her that the House of Black and White is a place of peace. He asks her for her name, but despite Arya's use of nicknames, the man keeps asking until she admits that she is Arya Stark. When the man asks if she feared death, Arya answers no. The man removes his cowl to reveal a decaying, horrible visage, but she sees through the illusion. Impressed, the Kindly Man asks if she is hungry, to which Arya thinks: Yes, but not for food.
<h2>	Cersei (II)   pg 99        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Orton Merryweather (Lord of Longtable, bannerman to Lord Mace Tyrell, husband of Lady Taena of Myr, met his wife while in exile with his grandfather, Lord Owen Merryweather; later named Justiciar [Cersei's new title for Master of Laws] of King Tommen, then shortly after Hand of the King to replace Ser Harys Swyft);</p>
<p>Ser Balman Byrch* (husband of Lady Falyse Stokeworth, once a renowned jouster; killed by Ser Bronn);</p>
<p>Ser Lambert Turnberry (a knight sworn to the Iron Throne).</p>
<p>Legends: King Garth Gardener (Garth the Twelfth, High King of the Reach from the Gardener line of kings).</p>
<p>Arriving at the Great Sept of Baelor for Lord Tywin's wake, Cersei goes from worrying about Tommen's health to contemplating the removal of the current High Septon, a man appointed by Tyrion. Tommen and Cersei both notice the stench emanating from her father's corpse. After the service, the procession of mourners come to offer condolences to Cersei. First is Falyse Stokeworth, who mentions that her sister is ready to give birth and the family would like to name the child Tywin. Cersei replies, "Your lackwit sister gets herself raped by half of King's Landing, and Tanda thinks to honor the bastard with my lord father's name? I think not." Next is Lancel, still looking half dead, and as he begins to mention his love and then his new-found faith, Cersei heads him off by saying, "Atonement is best achieved through prayer. Silent prayer."</p>
<p>The only mourner to please Cersei is Lady Taena Merryweather, who promises that all her friends in the Free Cities have been notified to watch for and seize Tyrion. When Lord Mace comes before her, he mentions that his uncle Garth is on the way to assume the duties of Master of Coin. The Queen Regent immediately backpedals that Lord Gyles Rosby has already accepted the post, not wishing to see another Tyrell on the small council. This angers Lord Tyrell and his mother, as Lord Tywin had wanted Garth the Gross to assume the position. The Queen of Thorns then brings up the terrible smell in the sept, and Cersei wants nothing more than to get rid of the clever old woman. But Lady Olenna states she will not depart until Margaery is wed to Tommen. Leaving the Sept, Cersei rides back to the Red Keep with Lord Gyles, asking him belatedly to be her new master of coin, which he accepts.</p>
<p>Back in her rooms, Qyburn pays her a visit, revealing that he had found a gold coin in the undergaoler's sleeping cell that dated back to the Gardener Kings of the Reach. Once again, Cersei is suspicious that the Tyrells had a hand in Tyrion's escape and Lord Tywin's murder. Qyburn then asks if he may experiment on the dying Ser Gregor in the black cells, since he is more adept at the nature of death than any of the archmaesters from the Citadel. She agrees with his request, but tells him to bring her Gregor's head when he dies, as her father had promised it to Dorne. Finally, that night, Ser Kevan meets with her for dinner, as she had requested.</p>
<p>Thinking to find her uncle a loyal, dutiful partner like he was to her father, Cersei asks him to be Tommen's Hand. Kevan first advises her it was a mistake to make a fool of Mace Tyrell in front of half the court. He then reminds her that he would rather help his son Lancel take control of Castle Darry; but he will take up position as Hand, provided Cersei removes herself from King's Landing and returns to Casterly Rock. Infuriated, she blurts out, "I was sick with grief, I did not think-" Ser Kevan interrupts her by saying, "No. Which is why you should return to Casterly Rock and leave the king with those who do." Throwing her wine in his face, she begins to threaten her uncle. Unfazed, Ser Kevan counsels her to name Lord Tarly her Hand, stating, "Randyll Tarly is the finest soldier in the realm. A poor Hand for peacetime, but with Tywin dead there's no better man to finish this war." Departing, Ser Kevan Lannister also reveals that he knows who Tommen's father really is.

<h2>	Jaime (I) {X}   pg 116        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Rennifer Longwaters (chief undergaoler of the dungeons under the Red Keep, claims to be a descendant of a Targaryen princess).</p>
<p>Legends: Lord Quenton Hightower (Lord of the Port and Voice of Oldtown during the grey plague some 70 years ago; killed by the people of Oldtown after the plague).</p>
<p>Standing a planned seven day vigil over his father's funeral bier, Ser Jaime finds himself with a lot of time for thinking. He feels that he is as much to blame for his father's death as Tyrion or Varys. He also finds himself wondering what happened to Varys. His thoughts then turn to the day that Prince Rhaegar rode for the Trident. Jaime had asked not to be left behind to guard the king, but Rhaegar told him that Aerys feared Lord Tywin, and meant to keep Jaime at his side as insurance. Mounting up, Rhaegar's last words to Jaime were, "When this battle's done I mean to call a council. Changes will be made. I meant to do it long ago, but...well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken." Finally, he recalls his recent questioning of the chief undergaoler, which was a complete farce as Jaime knew far more than the man did, since he was the perpetrator.</p>
<p>When Jaime learns that the two gaolers who were put to sleep were killed by Ser Boros and Ser Osmund, he reprimands them, warning them never to act on his sister's orders to kill anyone without consulting him first. Some time in the middle of the night, Cersei visits him with news of Ser Kevan's refusal. She implores him to reconsider being Hand, but Jaime rejects her again. She departs with, "Very well. If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you." The next morning, the mourners arrive anew, but the smell is so nauseating that Tommen gets sick. Jaime takes him outside to console him, advising him to "go away inside", something Tommen understood from when Joffrey would torment him. Cersei then joins them, as does Mace Tyrell, and Jaime asks the Lord of Highgarden to have dinner with his sister. When Mace departs, Jaime tells Cersei to get the wedding over with, and then send Lord Mace to beseige Storm's End once again. Cersei likes the idea, hoping Tyrell might lose his life this time.
<h2>	Brienne (II)  pg 130        </h2>
	<u>Introduced:</u> Ser Rufus Leek (castellan of the Dun Fort in Duskendale);</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Renfred Rykker (Lord of Duskendale, currently in the field under Lord Randyll Tarly);</p>
<p>Septa Roelle (Brienne's septa and tutor at Evenfall Hall on Tarth);</p>
<p>Ser Goodwin* (master-at-arms on Tarth, trained Brienne);</p>
<p>Lord Denys Darklyn* (last Lord of Duskendale from house Darklyn, as his line was extinguished; the Darklyns counted 7 members in the Kingsguard, more than any other house; beheaded by command of King Aerys II for his orchestration of the Defiance of Duskendale);</p>
<p>Lady Serala Darklyn* (of Myr, called the Lace Serpent, wife of Lord Denys; believed by many to have been the real orchestrator of the Defiance of Duskendale [when Lord Denys had King Aerys II kidnapped for nearly half a year], burned alive by order of King Aerys);</p>
<p>Ser Symon Hollard* (master-at-arms in Duskendale during the Defiance, killed Ser Gwayne Gaunt of the Kingsguard, slain by Ser Barristan the Bold while the kingsguard was rescuing the King);</p>
<p>Ser Jon Hollard* (steward of Duskendale, married to Lord Denys Darklyn's sister, killed for his role in the Defiance, his house attainted);</p>
<p>Robin Hollard* (a squire in Duskendale, died upon the rack by command of Mad King Aerys);</p>
<p>Ser Steffon Hollard* (father of Ser Dontos, twin brother of Ser Symon, died before the Defiance);</p>
<p>Ser Humfrey Wagstaff* (Lord Grandison's castellan, Brienne's third and last betrothed).</p>
<p>When Brienne reaches Duskendale, she finds the gates barred for the night. The area surrounding is littered with corpses of both northmen and men from the Reach. The gates open at morning, and the captain tells Brienne that his sister can paint over the black bat of Lothston on her shield. After telling the sister what sigil she wants, Brienne heads to the Dun Fort to speak to the lord. Since Lord Rykker is in the field, she meets with the castellan, who tells her that many came before her asking if Ser Dontos Hollard and Sansa had come to Duskendale. We then learn the story of the Defiance of Duskendale, which seems to have been the incident that finally sent King Aerys over the edge.</p>
<p>Either of his own initiative, or from the urgings of his wife, Lord Denys Darklyn took Aerys hostage. When Lord Tywin (who was Hand at the time) surrounded the Dun Fort, Lord Darklyn threatened to kill Aerys. When Aerys was captured, Ser Symon Hollard killed one of his kingsguard, Ser Gwayne Gaunt. After Ser Barristan the Bold slipped into the Dun Fort and rescued the king, Aerys had nearly every member of the Darklyn and Hollard families killed or attainted. Ser Dontos was young at the time, but Ser Barristan asked Aerys to stay his hand. The castellan tells Brienne that Duskendale would have been the last place Dontos would have fled to. Despairing that she will never find Sansa, Brienne bumps into a boy whom she had seen back at Rosby, but he runs away.</p>
<p>Visiting the inn for dinner, Brienne meets a pious dwarf, who tells her that he overheard a man called Nimble Dick in Maidenpool bragging that he had "fooled a fool" seeking passage for three across the Narrow Sea. That night, Brienne dreams of Renly's death, but when he topples after the shadow killed him, the body is that of Jaime. The next day, Brienne picks up her shield, and the sigil is that of Ser Duncan the Tall that Tanselle had painted for him. Proceeding to Maidenpool, Brienne camps by the ruins of the Hollard castle, and hears a rider. Fearing it may be Ser Shadrich and that she would need to fight him, she discovers the boy who seemed to be stalking her. It turns out to be Podrick Payne, who asks to stay with her, hoping that if she finds Sansa, it may lead the boy back to Tyrion.

<h2>	Sansa (I) {XXII}  pg 145        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Gretchel (servingwoman to Lord Robert Arryn at the Eyrie);</p>
<p>Maddy (called Fat Maddy, another servingwoman at the Eyrie);</p>
<p>Ser Marwyn Belmore (captain of the guards at the Gates of the Moon, previously captain of the guards at the Eyrie until Littlefinger had him replaced; called Ser Ding-Dong by Marillion).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Lyonel Corbray (Lord of Heart's Home, bannerman of the Arryns, older brother of Ser Lyn Corbray);</p>
<p>Ser Ronnel Arryn* (younger brother of Lord Jon Arryn, served as Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, father of Elbert Arryn).</p>
<p>Marillion, whose eyes were put out, has been singing from his sky cell day and night. Sansa easily convinces herself that Lord Petyr's lies were for the best, even if Marillion wasn't guilty of pushing her aunt. After all, had it not been for Littlefinger, Marillion might have raped her in the Baelish household on the Fingers. Waiting for Lord Nestor Royce to arrive, Littlefinger tells Sansa that he has persuaded the bard to cooperate with the High Steward. She has come to notice that there are two distinct sides to Petyr Baelish: the kind, authoritative Lord Petyr, and the manipulative, deceptive Littlefinger. She thinks to herself, A lie is not so bad if it is kindly meant.</p>
<p>When Lord Nestor arrives, Littlefinger sends Sansa, who is now almost a pro at playing the part of Alayne Stone, to bring Lord Robert. Lysa and Jon Arryn's boy has taken to sleeping in Sansa's bed of late, as a substitute for his mother. In the High Hall, Robert doesn't last long before he begins shaking, but Nestor Royce and his party are completely convinced of the bard's guilt. They had seen firsthand Marillion's contempt, and the lavish gifts Lady Lysa had given him. Littlefinger even pretends that it was his fault, for not being in Lysa's presence, and obtains the sympathy of the Steward's party. Lord Nestor and his son declare that Marillion must die, so he is sent back to his sky cell. Petyr then invites Lord Nestor to join him and his daughter in the Lower Hall.</p>
<p>Littlefinger, now holding the title of Lord Protector of the Vale and wanting to keep it, heaps praise on Nestor Royce, telling him that both Jon and Lysa Arryn relied on him more than any other. Nestor reveals that his cousin, Bronze Yohn, and several other Arryn bannerman are on their way to the Eyrie to remove Petyr from his post, but Littlefinger already knew. He then shows Lord Nestor the document he had written up and signed, saying that it was really Lysa's idea, to make the Keeper of the Gates of the Moon the hereditary post of Lord Nestor's house. Shocked, since the post had never been hereditary and was never a true lordship, Nestor is extremely appreciative. Afterwards, Littlefinger continues training Sansa in the art of playing the game of thrones, revealing that he signed the document himself so that if he gets removed from office, Lord Nestor would lose his writ. This doubly insures the High Steward's support against the Lords Declarant when they come to the Eyrie. He leaves off by saying, "With my wits and Cat's beauty, the world will be yours..."

<h2>	The Kraken's Daughter (PoV: Asha Greyjoy)   pg 159        </h2></p>

<p>Lady Gwynesse (widowed sister of Lord Rodrik Harlaw and Lady Alannys Greyjoy);</p>
<p>Lady Alannys Greyjoy (of House Harlaw, wife of Lord Balon, mother of Rodrik, Maron, Asha and Theon, younger sister of Lord Rodrik, called Lanny by the Reader);</p>
<p>Lady Sybelle Glover (of  house Locke, wife of Robett Glover, Lady of Deepwood Motte);</p>
<p>Lord Baelor Blacktyde* (Lord of Blacktyde on the isle of Blacktyde, master of the Nightflyer; killed by command of King Euron);</p>
<p>Blind Beron Blacktyde, The Old Grey Gull (priests of the Drowned God).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Maester Wendamyr (maester and counselor at Pyke);</p>
<p>Lord Sawane Botley* (former Lord of Lordsport, father of Harren and Tristifer, brother of Germund; drowned by Euron Crow's Eye);</p>
<p>Harren Botley* (eldest son of Lord Sawane, brother of Tristifer; died at Moat Cailin);</p>
<p>Maester Qalen* (former maester at Pyke).</p>
<p>Legends: Lord Theomore Harlaw (great, great grandfather of Lord Rodrik, built the Ten Towers);</p>

<p>Archmaester Rigney (archmaester of the Citadel who wrote famous words on history);</p>
<p>Maester Denestan (author of Questions).</p>
<p>Asha is disturbed by the small turnout of supporters for her claim on the Seastone Chair. Her captains and champions are being hosted in the great hall of the Ten Towers, the seat of her favorite uncle, Lord Rodrik Harlaw. Asha asks her uncle's steward to take care of her captives from Deepwood Motte, then goes to speak privately with her uncle. She decides not to visit her mother now, as Lady Alannys' mind was not as strong as it once was. News of Theon might be the end of her, and that would hurt her uncle as well, who took care of both of his sisters, neither of them very healthy. She finds her uncle in his library, as he isn't called the Reader for nought. Lord Rodrik tells her he is reading Archmaester Marwyn's current book regarding the discovery of pages from an ancient Targaryen prophecy dating before the Doom.</p>
<p>The conversation soon turns to Euron's return on the day after King Balon's fall. Asha is sure he had a hand in his brother's death, and asks her uncle why so few supporters showed up for her. The Reader tells her of Aeron's call for a kingsmoot on Old Wyk, and Asha likes the idea, although she's unsure whether her uncles Euron and Victarion intend to attend. Lord Harlaw warns her not to go, reminding her that the Crow's Eye might try to kill all his competitors. Besides, the Reader doesn't feel that the Iron Islands should continue along the path that King Balon had chosen, stating, "The Old Way served the isles well when we were one small kingdom amongst many, but Aegon's Conquest put an end to that." </p>
<p>When the Reader asks her about Theon's fate, Asha admits that while she believes him to be dead, they never found his body at Winterfell. She takes her leave, but not before telling her uncle that she will attend the kingsmoot and place her claim. Outside of the Ten Towers, Asha meets Tristifer Botley, once a boy she had strong affections for years back on Pyke. Tris' father was drowned by Euron for declaring that the Crow's Eye had no right to the throne. Tris mentions that Euron is buying support left and right with his ill-gained loot, including Tris' uncle who was named Lord of Lordsport over himself. But Tristifer is not so interested in all that, he is far more interested in resuming his romance with Asha. But she'll have none of it, calling him a fool for not seeing other women all these years. Tris does pledge his support to her claim, however.

<h2>	Cersei (III)   pg 172        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Lyle Crakehall (called Strongboar, a renowned knight once taken captive at Riverrun; second son of Lord Roland Crakehall);</p>
<p>Wat (a singer self-styled 'the Blue Bard', a favorite of Queen Margaery's).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Jeyne Farman (once a ward at Casterly Rock who persuaded Cersei to visit Maggy the Frog; sister of the Lord of Fair Isle);</p>
<p>Maggy the Frog* (an old woods witch and seeress whom Cersei had visited when she was a teen; a maegi and bloodmage from the east, married a wealthy merchant and their son was raised to a petty lord by Lord Tytos Lannister; very possibly the grandmother of Lady Sybell Westerling);</p>
<p>Melara Hetherspoon* (a childhood friend of Cersei's and a ward at Casterly Rock who went with her to the woods witch; soon after, she supposedly betrayed Cersei, then drowned in a well);</p>
<p>Lord Owen Merryweather* (Hand of King Aerys II after Lord Tywin, exiled to the Free Cities by Aerys, as was his successor Lord Jon Connington; grandfather of Lord Orton Merryweather; died in exile).</p>
<p>Legends: Ossifer Plumm (supposedly fathered a child despite being dead);</p>
<p>King Viserys I Targaryen (fifth of the Targaryen dragonkings, grandson of King Jaeherys the Concilliator [as stated in the Appendix of AGOT, although contradicted elsewhere; it fits better if Viserys I was Jaehaerys' grandson]; father of Princess Rhaenyra and King Aegon II, it is believed that he intended for his daughter to succeed him) .</p>
<p>Cersei is remembering her concession to the Queen of Thorns to allow Tommen and Margaery to sleep in the same bed on their wedding night only, when Jaime arrives to speak to her. He asks if she still means to burn down the Tower of the Hand after the wedding, but she is determined to see it destroyed, and hopefully smoke out a few rats in the process. We begin to notice Cersei's progressive downward spiral in her mental health, exemplified by her obvious weight gain and her overindulgence in alcohol. Tommen's wedding is a modest affair compared to his brother's, and the ceremony goes over well enough. Afterwards, Ser Kevan comes over to Cersei and mentions that Sandor Clegane was reported to have joined Lord Beric Dondarrion's outlaws. The queen is already aware of this, having heard that outlaws had pillaged Saltpans and savagely raped the townswomen. The report mentioned that they were led by a huge man in a hound's head helmet.</p>
<p>Cersei suggests that Ser Lancel hunt down the Hound, but her uncle scoffs, "My son is not the man to deal with Sandor Clegane." When she then suggests that he go after Clegane, Ser Kevan responds, "When a dog goes bad, the fault lies with its master." To Jaime, she wonders if Margaery is really a maiden, and he tells her that Mace Tyrell will be marching on Storm's End in a few days, while Ser Garlan will take half the Tyrell host to Brightwater Keep and then on to Highgarden, including Lady Alerie and Lady Olenna. During the reception, Cersei recalls her visit to a woods witch when she was younger, and the old hag's words: Queen you shall be, until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear. Drinking heavily during the feast, she begins to wonder if Margaery is the one in the hag's prophecy, which also mentions the valonqar.</p>
<p>        When Tommen chokes on his wine accidentally, Cersei flees the hall for some air. She is met outside by Lady Taena, who offers that one of Cersei's maids is a spy reporting to Margaery's cousins. Cersei assumes it is Senelle, and promises to reward Lady Merryweather if this is true. Asking why the beauty from Myr would venture this info, Taena responds that she wants what is best for her husband and son, and Cersei could provide advancement for her family. Back inside, Cersei refuses to dance with anyone, but takes note of how attractive the Bastard of Driftmark, Aurane Waters, was: with his silvery hair- a mark of house Velaryon which was descended from the Freehold of Valyria like the Targaryens- he almost resembled Prince Rhaegar. </p>
<p>        Towards the end of the night, Cersei leads everyone outside to watch as the pyromancers set the Tower of the Hand on fire. As the green flames of wildfire consume the Tower, the queen regent compares the beauty of the spectacle to Joffrey. As the others begin to depart for bed, Cersei remains behind to watch the fires burn, arm in arm with Ser Osmund Kettleblack.

<h2>	The Soiled Knight (PoV: Ser Arys Oakheart)   pg 185        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septa Eglantine (Princess Myrcella's septa and tutor);</p>
<p>Ser Gascoyne of the Greenblood (Prince Trystane Martell's sworn shield).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Prince Quentyn Martell (second child and eldest son of Prince Doran, brother of Arianne and Trystane, has been a ward of Lord Anders Yronwood for years, serving as a page and squire, recently knighted by Lord Yronwood; currently across the Narrow Sea in Myr);</p>
<p>Prince Trystane Martell (Trys, youngest child of Prince Doran, betrothed to Princess Myrcella);</p>
<p>Lord Anders Yronwood (Lord of Yronwood, Warden of the Stone Way, the Bloodroyal, bannerman to Prince Doran, fostering Prince Quentyn for several years);</p>
<p>Dorea and Loreza Sand (youngest of the Sand Snakes, two of Ellaria and Oberyn's four daughters).</p>
<p>Legends: Lord Edgerran Oakheart (the Open-Handed, Lord of Old Oaks who collected Dornish heads);</p>
<p>Ser Olyvar Oakheart (the Green Oak, Kingsguard to King Daeron I, died at the Young Dragon's side in Dorne);</p>
<p>Prince Maron Martell (Lord of Sunspear during the reign of Good King Daeron, elder brother of Queen Myriah Targaryen, married Daeron II's sister in the dual weddings that sealed the alliance of Dorne);</p>
<p>Ser Terrence Toyne (Kingsguard who was caught sleeping with one of King Aegon IV's mistresses, it cost him his life and the downfall of his house; slain by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight in single combat- this was the impetus that led to Toyne's brothers' attempt to assassinate King Aegon IV; during the attempt, Prince Aemon was killed defending his brother, King Aegon);</p>
<p>Ser Lucamore Strong (called Lucamore the Lusty, a Kingsguard with 3 wives and 16 children, sent to the Wall when this was discovered by King Jaeherys I);</p>
<p>Ser Criston Cole (Criston the Kingmaker, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the reign of King Viserys I and King Aegon II; may have incited the war called the Dance of the Dragons by falsely declaring it was Viserys' dying wish that his son Aegon succeed him, and not his elder daughter Rhaenyra; considered by some to have been a vindicative act as Rhaenyra had once been his lover).</p>
<p>Slipping through the shadow city of Sunspear during the night for a rendezvous with Princess Arianne, Ser Arys Oakheart considers how unlikely it is for an Oakheart to even be in Dorne. Hailing from the Reach, the Oakhearts had long been enemies of the Dornish. The kingsguard knight had left Myrcella playing cyvasse with Prince Trystane, and under the protection of the prince's sworn shield Ser Gascoyne. Ser Aerys recalls his recent first meeting with Prince Doran, who advised him that Myrcella would be safer at the Water Gardens. All her guards and Ser Arys would accompany them there, but Doran asked him not to write King's Landing about the move. When he arrives at Arianne's secret location, he swore he would do no more than tell her it had to end, but her nakedness overwhelmed him, as it always did.</p>
<p>After their passion is sated, Arys is once again consumed by guilt, but Arianne has a response for every one of his doubts. The knight feels he has dishonored himself enough already, and he doesn't want to dishonor her. But Arianne's seductive words and gestures are difficult for him to disregard. When Arianne reminds him that he had told her he loved her, Arys responds that he had sworn a vow. However, Arianne brings up several kingsguard who had broken their vows, most famously Lucamore the Lusty and Ser Terrence Toyne, and even Prince Aemon the Dragonknight (though Ser Arys doesn't believe that story). She finishes with, "It is not our love that dishonored you, it is the monsters you have served and the brutes you've called your brothers." When Arys tells her that King Robert was no monster, he can't help but think that she was right about Joffrey.</p>
<p>And although he considers Tommen to be Joffrey's opposite, he can't disagree with Arianne's persuasive words that Myrcella would be a better ruler. Their conversation moves to Ser Criston Cole, Lord Commander of Viserys I's Kingsguard, and his declaration of the reversal of the king's wishes that his daughter Rhaenyra succeed him. Arianne reminds him that in Dorne, the eldest child rules, and had it not been for Criston the Kingmaker, even the Targaryen inheritance might have been rewritten. She then explains to him the real reason that Myrcella is being moved to the Water Gardens- "To keep her away from those who'd seek to crown her." Arys tells her that the Water Gardens are not a prison, but she warns him, "...she will not be allowed to leave...Hotah will see to that. You do not know him as I do. He is terrible when aroused."</p>
<p>Still unable to convince him that her suggestions are correct, Arianne hugs him and begins to tremble. Once again, she manipulates him by asserting that if the Sand Snakes can be imprisoned by her father for wanting to crown Myrcella, she could too. She mentions that there are no secrets between Tyene and herself, and then tells him how her father has never considered her worthy. Prince Doran had tried several times to marry her off to old men of high birth, and when she was 14 she had discovered a letter her father had written to her brother Quentyn, a ward of Lord Yronwood for years. In the letter, Doran wrote, "one day you will sit where I sit and rule all of Dorne, and a ruler must be strong of mind and body." </p>
<p>Ser Arys argues that this couldn't be true, but when she asks him where Prince Quentyn is now and his response is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway, Arianne tells him that is what her father wants everyone to believe. She has gotten word from some of her friends that Quentyn was across the narrow sea, and she is sure that he is hiring the Golden Company, who had recently broken their contract with Myr. The Golden Company had never broken their word since Bittersteel had reformed them nearly a hundred years ago, and since most of their members are exiles, the only reason they would change allegiance would be to return home to Westeros. And Lord Anders' ancestors had fought alongside Aegor Rivers (Bittersteel, for those who haven't read "The Sworn Sword") in three of the Blackfyre Rebellions, a fact that convinces Arianne that he seeks to crown Quentyn as the next Prince of Dorne.</p>
<p>Arianne's final persuasive words are, "So your two princesses share a common cause, ser... and they share as well a knight who claims to love them both, but will not fight for them." Ser Arys then swears to defend Myrcella's right to rule, and to protect Arianne from anyone seeking to steal her birthright. When he asks her what she would have of him, Arianne purrs, "All. All my love, my sweet love, and forever. But first...Myrcella."

<h2>	Brienne (III)   pg 199        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Hyle Hunt (knight sworn to Horn Hill, one of Lord Randyll's captains; once a "suitor" of Brienne);</p>
<p>Lord William Mooton (Lord of Maidenpool, bannerman to Riverrun now sworn to King Tommen);</p>
<p>Dick Crabb* (called Nimble Dick, a thief who claims to be from house Crabb of Crackclaw Point; killed by Shagwell the Fool).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Alyn Hunt (cousin of Ser Hyle, also a knight sworn to house Tarly);</p>
<p>Eleanor Mooton (eldest daughter and heir of Lord William, betrothed to Dickon Tarly);</p>
<p>Ser Cedric Payne* (knight sworn to Casterly Rock who took in Podrick after his father died; killed in the Riverlands with Lord Tywin's army);</p>
<p>Ser Lorimer the Belly* (hedge knight who served in Lord Tywin's baggage train; hung by Lord Tywin for stealing);</p>
<p>Ser Edmund Ambrose, Ser Hugh Beesbury, Ser Owen Inchfield, Ser Richard Farrow*, Will the Stork*, Big Ben Bushy* (soldiers, knights and hedge knights who answered Lord Renly's call to arms back at Highgarden; all "suitors" of Brienne who shamed her).</p>
<p>Legends: Ser Clarence Crabb (a knight eight feet tall with a woods witch for a wife).</p>
<p> Drawing near Maidenpool, Pod Payne can't seem to remember if Brienne is a knight or a lady, frequently calling her 'My Lady. Ser.' Brienne has taken up his training, abandoned since Ser Aron Santagar was killed by the mob in King's Landing. They soon come upon a farmer, his wife and their cart of eggs bound for Maidenpool. Riding together, the farmer tells Brienne that the city has been mostly rebuilt, thanks to the hard hand of Lord Randyll Tarly. The Maid of Tarth hopes she can slip through town without encountering the Lord of Horn Hill, as she owed him a debt but bore no liking for the man. At the gates of Maidenpool, the captain informs the farmer that he will take his eggs, forcing Brienne to draw her sword. Outnumbered by the gate guards, she is spared fighting by the appearance of Ser Hyle Hunt, a knight highly placed in Lord Tarly's army and a man whom Brienne despises.</p>
<p>Unable to keep himself from mocking her, Brienne warns him that she will sort him out in a melee some day, just as she had Red Ronnet Connington during the melee at Ashford. She asks him the location of the Stinking Goose, but Ser Hyle takes her to see Lord Randyll first. The commander of Lord Mace's vanguard is dispensing his harsh brand of justice when they come upon him. When she is brought before him, Lord Tarly asks her if she killed Renly, and then states he should ship her back to Tarth. But Brienne reveals the King's document that Jaime had given her, and she informs Lord Randyll that she is seeking Sansa. He responds that Sansa is not in Maidenpool, nor would she be in the Vale, as Brienne had also assumed, since Lysa Arryn was dead.</p>
<p>Shocked to have learned that Sansa's aunt was dead, Brienne heads off to the tavern, sending Ser Hyle off when he attempts to apologize for his actions at Highgarden. Later, awaiting the arrival of Nimble Dick at the Stinking Goose, she recalls the hurtful game Ser Hyle and his friends played at her expense. Brienne had gone to Highgarden to answer Lord Renly's call to banners, expecting to be ridiculed. But unbelievably, many of the young knights she met were exceedingly kind to her, going above and beyond the others to win her favor. Wary of their intentions, Brienne was still vulnerable thanks to hope, but she soon learned the truth. Lord Randyll called her before him to reveal what he had learned of their game through his son Dickon. The knights involved had a burgeoning wager on who could claim her maidenhead. Lord Tarly ended their game, but told her the fault lie with herself: "...(These are) honorable men. The blame is yours. Your being here encouraged them...A war host is no place for a maiden."</p>
<p>When Dick Crabb finally arrives, Brienne offers to buy him drinks. Nimble Dick soon launches into his story, egged on by a steady bribe from Brienne, he explains how he had offered to help a frightened fool make it across the narrow sea. The fool claimed he had two girls with him, but couldn't chance the ports in Maidenpool. So Dick had taken his coin and took him and the girls along the shore to an old, now-unused smuggler's cove, up past Crackclaw Point. Nimble Dick agrees to take her there for a large sum of coin, pointing out that he is from the area, and warns Brienne of the Whispers, a keep built by a mythical ancestor of his, Ser Clarence Crabb...

<p><u>Introduced:</u> Old Tattersalt (captain of the Blackbird, a member of the Night's Watch from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea).</p>
<p>Sam is trying his best to keep both Gilly and himself calm during the tumultuous sea trip to Braavos. The Night's Watch ship Blackbird would take them only so far as Braavos, and then Sam would need to find tender there bound for Oldtown. Sam is hopeful that the others making the journey with him will find happiness when they reach their destination: Gilly and the babe at Horn Hill, Maester Aemon back at the Citadel, and Dareon in his new role as a recruiter. The old maester tells them the story of his sea trip to the Wall- how he traveled with Lord Commander Ser Duncan the Tall as his honor guard, along with Brynden Rivers, Lord Bloodraven himself, who was sent by Egg to serve out the remainder of his life in the Watch.</p>
<p>           As the trip progresses, Sam finds that nothing he says can console Gilly, and that Maester Aemon's health deteriorates. Dareon has nothing but scorn for the wildling girl, but Aemon tells Sam to look closely at the baby to find the source of Gilly's grief. When Sam realizes that the baby is actually Dalla and Mance's, not her own, he can't believe what Jon did. Maester Aemon states, "What threats the Lord Commander made, what promises, I can only guess." And while Sam understands that Jon did so to save the baby from Melisandre's fires, he remains shocked at what cost this would have on Gilly.

<h2>	Jaime (II) {XI}   pg 226        </h2>
	<u>Introduced:</u> Lord Tytos Brax (Lord of Hornvale, bannerman to the Lannisters, brother of Ser Flement, son of the late Lord Andros, nephew of Ser Rupert);</p>
<p>Lord Antario Jast (bannerman to the Lannisters, rumored to have died on the Riverlands);</p>
<p>Lord Quenten Banefort (Lord of Banefort, another Lannister bannerman);</p>
<p>Lord Garrison Prester (Lord of Feastfires, a minor lord sworn to Casterly Rock, cousin of Ser Forley);</p>
<p>Lord Robin Moreland (minor lord sworn to the Lannisters);</p>
<p>Lord Philip Plumm (minor lord sworn to Casterly Rock, father of Ser Harwyn Plumm);</p>
<p>Ser Jon Bettley (Beardless Jon, a knight sworn to the Lannisters);</p>
<p>Ser Alyn Stackspear (younger son of Lord Selmond Stackspear, another knight sworn to Casterly Rock);</p>
<p>Ser Humfrey Swyft (yet another knight in service to Casterly Rock).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Damion Lannister (distant cousin to Jaime and Cersei; currently Castlellan of Casterly Rock).</p>
<p>Legends: The Greatheart (legendary Kingsguard or Lord Commander from the past);</p>
<p>Ser Gyles Greycloak (kingsguard who turned traitor);</p>
<p>Ser Orivel the Open-Handed (kingsguard known as a coward);</p>
<p>Ser Tom Costayne (called Long Tom, kingsguard for 60 years);</p>
<p>Ser Addison Hill, Red Robert Flowers (bastards who rose to Lord Commander of the Kingsguard);</p>
<p>Ser Michael Mertyns (called the White Owl, another kingsguard);</p>
<p>Ser Jeffory Norcross (called Neveryield, yet another kingsguard);</p>
<p>Ser Rolland Darklyn (youngest kingsguard other than Jaime, died within an hour of donning his white cloak, but saved the King's life [possibly the Young Dragon?]).</p>
<p>An honor procession flanks Lord Tywin's casket as it heads west, led by many of the Lannister bannermen. Jaime falls in with his Uncle Kevan, and they discuss the attack on Saltpans. Jaime cautions his uncle not to try and take on Clegane or Dondarrion, and that he would have made a good Hand. Ser Kevan tells him that his terms have not changed. As Jaime rides off, he considers the possibility that Cersei may try to have their uncle killed, considering his rejection to be a malleable Hand and his knowledge of their incest. He then tries to speak with his now-pious cousin Lancel, to discover if Tyrion had been lying about Lancel's affair with Cersei. But the soon-to-be-married Lancel, and his accompanying septons, provide no answers.</p>
<p>As Jaime returns to King's Landing, he looks upon the encamped Lannister army, which will soon board Lord Redwyne's fleet to lay siege to Dragonstone. He finds his sister in her solar as Grand Maester Pycelle delivers news that Ser Bronn has named Lollys' bastard newborn "Tyrion". Jaime realizes that his sister may try to have Bronn killed for this jape, and he recalls the look on her face the night of Tommen's wedding when the Tower of the Hand was aflame. This called to mind the memory of King Aerys' "rape" of his wife the evening he had had Lord Chelsted burned alive. Jaime had the guard of the queen's bedchamber when she was screaming at her husband. When Jaime said that they were sworn to protect her too, his partner that night, Ser Jonothor Darry, said, "We are, but not from him."</p>
<p>Jaime asks to speak with Cersei alone, and asks her why she keeps Lady Taena around all the time, knowing that she is a spy for Margaery. Cersei responds that Taena is more herspy, considering that the Queen Regent can do more for the Merryweather family. Jaime cautions that she doesn't truly know the woman, but Cersei remarks that she may make Taena's husband the Hand. After Jaime asks her about the rumor that she planned to name Aurane Waters her new master of ships, he recommends that she would be better off naming Lord Paxter Redwyne. But Cersei will not put any Tyrells on her small council. She defends her choice of Qyburn to the council, and Jaime retorts, "You are seeing dwarves in every shadow and making foes of friends. Uncle Kevan is not your enemy. I am not your enemy." However, Cersei throws him out of her solar in fury.</p>
<p>In the White Sword Tower, Jaime speaks with Ser Loras Tyrell, asking him what he knew of certain famous kingsguard. Ser Loras is well-versed, but when the Lord Commander mentions some lesser-known kingsguard, the Knight of Flowers does not recognize the names. Jaime points out that all of them served well, perhaps even better than the famous knights. Loras remarks that the great kingsguard knights will always be remembered as heroes, but Jaime mentions Ser Criston Cole, the Kingmaker, who was perhaps more infamous than famous...

<h2>	Cersei (IV)   pg 238        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Dorcas (a servingwoman to Cersei);</p>
<p>Septons Torbert, Raynard, Ollidor, Luceon (septons of the Most Devout, vying for the now vacant High Septon position, later subjugated by the new High Septon and given menial tasks).</p>
<p>After yet another group presents her with a dwarf's head that is not her brother's (this one came from a "sparrow" dwarf, possibly the one Brienne had met), Cersei and Qyburn walk together to meet the small council. The new Master of Whisperers indicates that he has prepared the "skull" in an ebony box for delivery to Prince Doran, but no mention is made that it belonged to Ser Gregor. Pycelle is near apoplectic upon hearing that Qyburn has been raised to Lord and has replaced Varys on the council, and Cersei makes it clear how unfit she considers the old Grand Maester. Cersei has finalized her appointments, placing men she considers to be meek and loyal and giving them the titles used in the Free Cities. She now has a small council consisting of Orton Merryweather as Judiciar (master of laws), Aurane Waters as grand admiral (master of ships), and her Uncle Kevan's goodfather Ser Harys Swyft as"her" Hand. This last appointment she considers as a shield against any threat that Ser Kevan may present.</p>
<p>The council first discusses the unrest in Sunspear and Prince Doran's letter that he imprisoned the Sand Snakes. Cersei notes that they are sending Ser Balon Swann to Dorne with Ser Gregor's head as had been promised, but she does not mention that Ser Balon will have another task as well. We learn that the High Septon appointed by Tyrion had died in his "sleep", and the council brings up the continuing influx of "sparrows" into King's Landing, stirring up the populace with their preaching of "doom and demon worship". But Cersei cares not, nor does she care who becomes High Septon, provided he "pronounce(s) an anathema upon the Imp." The next topic is the Lords Declarant in the Vale of Arryn, but the Queen Regent decides not to intervene directly on Littlefinger's behalf, but only send a letter warning these Lords that no harm must come to Lord Petyr.</p>
<p>When the subject of rebuilding the fleet comes up, Cersei is adamant against making any pact with the ironborn, stating, "Their turn will come, once we have dealt with Stannis." Aurane Waters will get his fleet of dromonds however, and Cersei will find the coin by deferring the crown's debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos. Pycelle warns her against this route, cautioning that it would be foolish to make an enemy of the Iron Bank. The council also discusses the prudence of making someone pay for the Red Wedding so as to appease all the "sparrows"; by offering whoever succeeds the sure-to-die-soon Lord Walder a chance to rid himself of unwanted brothers, half-brothers and nephews.</p>
<p>On the topic of the North, the council indicates that Stannis may soon be confronted by Roose Bolton's army, once his bastard son hits Moat Cailin from the north, allowing the Lord of the Dreadfort passage through the Neck. Cersei mentions that Lord Wyman Manderly has taken Ser Davos Seaworth captive, after the latter was sent by Stannis to treat with him. Lord Manderly seeks the favor of the Iron Throne, and the Queen will recommend that he can achieve that favor if he beheads Stannis' Hand. When Sansa is mentioned, Cersei shocks the council into silence with a violent tirade about how she plans to deal with the girl once she is found. Next they debate the fact that the Night's Watch might be joining its might to Stannis, especially now that Jon Snow is their Lord Commander. The council decides to warn the Watch that the crown will stop sending men to the Wall, but Qyburn suggests that they do send 100 men. Cersei picks up on this, with the idea that the men sent will really be assassins ordered to remove Eddard Stark's bastard.</p>
<p>Back in her apartments, Cersei learns from Taena that Dorcas fancies Ser Osney Kettleblack, and also hints that she herself likes dangerous, scarred men. Cersei tries to learn the name of Taena's old flame, but the Myrish woman is evasive. When Osney arrives, Cersei butters him up with an offer to join the Kingsguard, and a chance to bed her again, provided he accomplishes a couple of tasks. First, Cersei wants him to seduce, and hopefully bed, Queen Margaery, thus leading to a complete downfall of the Tyrells. Second, she plans to send him to the Wall as "punishment" for his treason with Margaery, but in reality he will lead a group of men to assassinate Jon Snow; assuring him that the men would not be required to serve in the Watch after they complete their task. She also promises him a lordship, should he accomplish both missions. Later that night, Cersei asks Lady Taena to remark to Margaery that she has a secret admirer, but not to let out Ser Osney's name unless the girl probes.

<h2>	The Iron Captain (PoV: Victarion Greyjoy)   pg 255        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Nute the Barber (Victarion's first mate on the Iron Victory, chief of the Iron Captain's supporters; later risen to Lord of Oakenshield by King Euron);</p>
<p>Red Ralf Stonehouse, Ralf the Limper (champions of Victarion's claim to the Seastone Chair);</p>
<p>Ralf Kenning (given the command to hold Moat Cailin);</p>
<p>Fralegg the Strong, Alvyn Sharp, Will Humble, Little Lenwood Tawney, Romny Weaver (captains and supporters of Victarion's claim);</p>
<p>Eldred Codd (his house despised by all on the Iron Islands);</p>
<p>Lord Norne Goodbrother (Lord of Shatterstone on Old Wyk);</p>
<p>Euron Greyjoy (called Crow's Eye or Euron Croweye, eldest of Lord Balon's younger brothers, a raider and outlaw who has not been seen in three years, later claims the Seastone Chair when his brother dies and wins it outright during Aeron's Kingsmoot);</p>
<p>Lord Maron Volmark (Lord of Volmark on Harlaw, another of Victarion's supporters, considered by Tarle the Thrice-Drowned to be descended from King Harren the Black; later named Lord of Greenshield);</p>
<p>Lord Germund Botley (named Lord of Lordsport by Euron, brother of Lord Sawane, uncle of Tristifer; one of Euron's champions);</p>
<p>Lord Orkwood of Orkmont (one of the Lords on the island of Orkmont; a champion of Euron's claim to the Seastone Chair);</p>
<p>The Red Oarsman, Torwold Browntooth, Pinchface Jon Myre, Left-Hand Lucas Codd, Quellon Humble, Qarl the Thrall, Stonehand, Ralf the Shepherd, Ralf of Lordsport (all captains and supporters of Euron's claim).</p>
<p>Victarion has left the defense of Moat Cailin to Ralf Kenning, and sailed the Iron Fleet to Old Wyk for the kingsmoot. When the fleet arrives, Victarion has them blockade Euron's Silence. The first to greet him on shore is Aeron, and later that night the priest is at his side for the feast. Several captains pledge their voice to Victarion's claim, but Lord Blacktyde seeks a king who will end the wars, saying, "Balon was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all." Soon, the Captain finds his niece, advising her not to lay forth a claim, because a woman has no place ruling the ironborn. But their chat is interrupted by the arrival of Euron, who Victarion notes has not seemed to have aged in the almost 3 years he's been gone.</p>
<p>Aeron confronts Euron with the accusation that "no godless man may sit the Seastone Chair", but Euron cows his brother into leaving the hall. Asha then accuses her uncle of the death of her father, but Euron denies he had anything to do with it. When a fight nearly breaks out between Asha and one of Euron's men, Victarion steps in and demands that Euron leave. After his departure, Victarion and his niece walk outside, and Asha asks why Euron had been banished by her father, for he had refused to ever speak of it. Victarion eventually tells her, in part, that he had caught his third wife in bed with Euron. Balon would not let him kill Euron, for the kinslayer is accursed, but Victarion killed his wife with his own hands. Asha offers to set aside her claim if Victarion will name her his Hand and end the war, but the Iron Captain will have none of it. 


<h2>	The Drowned Man (PoV: Aeron Greyjoy)   pg 267        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Sigfry Stonetree (a sworn sword of Lord Rodrik Harlaw);</p>
<p>Andrik the Unsmiling (a giant reaver from the Iron Islands who supports the Drumm's claim at the kingsmoot; then named Lord of Southshield by King Euron);</p>
<p>Lord Gylbert Farwynd (Lord of the Lonely Light, a tiny island far west of the Iron Islands; puts forth a claim to the Seastone Chair);</p>
<p>Erik Ironmaker (called Erik Anvil-Breaker and Erik the Just, a famous captain and reaver, now an old, obese man);</p>
<p>Thormor (grandson and champion of Erik Ironmaker);</p>
<p>Lord Dunstan Drumm (called The Drumm, a lord on Old Wyk, bears the famed Valyrian sword 'Red Rain');</p>
<p>Denys and Donnel Drumm (sons of Lord Dunstan);</p>
<p>Cragorn* (a giant mute in service to Euron, dies after sounding the Valyrian dragon-binding horn);</p>
<p>Harmund Sharp (one of Asha's supporters; lost his son Harrag at Winterfell).</p>
<p>Legends: Vickon Greyjoy (first Lord of the Iron Islands during the Targaryen reign, chosen by the ironborn after King Harren the Black was burned by Balerion at Harrenhal);</p>
<p>Dale the Dread, Roryn the Reaver, Gormond Drumm the Oldfather, Hilmar Drumm the Cunning (legendary lords from house Drumm).</p>
<p>Aeron is wading in the ocean, berating himself for running from Euron. He considers Nagga's bones, where the Grey King had ruled for 1000 years and warred against the Storm God. At dawn, Aeron has his drowned men sound the drums and warhorns to announce the onset of the kingsmoot. The prophet wishes for Victarion to win the claim, and hopes Euron will make a mistake and declare early. But the first claimant is Lord Gylbert Farwynd, who rules a small barrier island far to the west of the Iron Islands. Said to be shapeshifters, Aeron sees madness in the lord's eyes. He offers to lead the ironmen to a bountiful land beyond the Sunset Sea, however, few of the gathered captains shout his name.</p>
<p>Next up is Erik Ironmaker, who once might have made a great king. But age and his immense weight make him an easy target for Asha to dismiss by asking him to stand up from his chair. The following claimant is another famous ironborn, Lord Dunstan Drumm, who asks the gathering, "Where is it written that our king must be a kraken?" But the Drumm's downfall is the cheap loot he offers to swing the vote of the captains. Victarion steps forth next and asks for Aeron's blessing. His speech is short and concise and he offers to continue the rule his brother Balon had set. His offerings are generous, and many captains give him their voice. </p>
<p>But it is Asha who interrupts the shouts of "Victarion!", and declares that her claim is best as she is Balon's daughter. She tells the ironborn that war is bleeding their people and to continue it would be folly. She offers peace with the Northmen, and prosperous land on the western shores of the North. When she opens her chests to show the scant spoils of her warring in the Northlands, the tumult of support she receives is staggering. Fearing that a woman will win the kingsmoot, Aeron is shocked back to reality by the horrible sounding of a horn. All eyes turn to the giant warhorn with the ancient Valyrian glyphs being sounded by one of Euron's "mongrels". After sounding the horn several times, the giant mute nearly falls over, his lips bloody and blistering.</p>
<p>Euron steps forward and announces that he has sailed further and braved more than any other ironman. He offers not only peace and land, but all Westeros itself to the ironborn. When Asha asks him how he means to do so, her uncle responds that he will use dragons to conquer the Seven Kingdoms, as Aegon had, using the warhorn he found amongst the ashes of Old Valyria. When he tells the crowd that the horn can bind dragons to his will, and that he knows where 3 dragons can be found, he receives the overwhelming cheers of "Euron! Euron! Crow's Eye! EURON KING!"

<h2>	Brienne (IV)   pg 280        </h2></p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Raymond Nayland, Harry Sawyer, Robin Potter (more of Brienne's "suitors" at Highgarden, whom she later bested in Renly's tourney).</p>
<p>Legends: Lord Lucifer Hardy, Old Crackbones (lords who had brought peace to Crackclaw Point);</p>
<p>Ser Clement Crabb, Ser Rupert Crabb (kingsguard from house Crabb);</p>
<p>Ser Clarence Crabb (called Clarence the Short, another kingsguard).</p>
<p>On the way to the cove where Nimble Dick had led the fool and his two companions, Pod catches Dick looking through Brienne's saddlebags. The Maid had known something like this might happen, and had warned Pod to keep an eye on him. But having no recourse but to follow him, they continue on their path to Crackclaw Point. Dick tells them some of the history of the region, to pass the monotony of their journey. Brienne's mistrust of Dick has made him take notice, and she considers how easy it is for her to suspect others, after the mistreatments she had suffered in her life. She remembers getting her revenge on several of her false suitors during the melee at Bitterbridge, but this had done little to stay her natural distrust. As they pass the Dyre Den, Lord Brune's castle, Pod takes note of a rider a couple miles behind them. When Brienne learns that Dick may have known Lord Brune, she considers the possibility that Dick was a deserter from the war.</p>
<p>After passing through many a treacherous bog and forest, they finally arrive at the ruins of the Whispers. Brienne commands Pod to watch their horses, as she and Dick investigate the ruins. When they find a recently put-out cookfire, Brienne realizes their quarry is still around. The trap is soon sprung, and the fool turns out to be Shagwell of the Bloody Mummers. Shagwell kills Nimble Dick with his brutal morningstar, then informs Brienne that Urswyck had rode south to Oldtown with some of the Mummers, while Rorge had headed for Saltpans. He also reveals a rumor that the "daughter of Lord Stark" had last been seen with Sandor Clegane. When Shagwell's two companions attack, Brienne's strength and size are too much for Pyg and Timeon, who fall quickly to her strokes with Oathkeeper. Squaring off against Shagwell, the Fool is struck in the head by a stone thrown by Podrick. Brienne forces the Fool to dig a grave for Dick, but upon completion of it, the former Brave Companion attacks her. She quickly dispatches him as well, and then she is surprised to hear a laugh from the ruined wall. It is Ser Hyle, who was the rider Pod had spied, sent by Lord Randyll to stay at Brienne's side in the off chance that she finds Sansa...

<h2>	The Queenmaker (PoV: Arianne Martell)   pg 235        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Andrey Dalt (called Drey, heir to Lemonwood, brother of Ser Deziel Dalt; one of Arianne's oldest and closest friends; sent by Prince Doran to Norvos to serve Lady Mellario as punishment for helping Arianne);</p>
<p>Lady Sylva Santagar (called Spotted Sylva, daughter and heir of Ser Symon Santagar, the Knight of Spottswood; another of Arianne's closest friends; later married to the elder Lord Eldon Estermont as punishment for her role in Arianne's scheme);</p>
<p>Garin (one of the orphans of the Greenblood, Arianne's milk brother and close companion; currently in Tyrosh to serve for his role in the plot to crown Myrcella);</p>
<p>Ser Gerold Dayne (called Darkstar, the Knight of High Hermitage, cousin and bannerman to Edric Dayne; a knight with a dangerous and unsavory reputation; also a cousin of Ser Arthur Dayne, Lady Ashara, and Lady Allyria);</p>
<p>Rosamund Lannister (a Lannister of Lannisport, distant cousin of Myrcella, serving Myrcella in Dorne as a bedmaid but was sent by Tyrion due to her strong resemblance to Myrcella).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Ormond Yronwood* (former Lord of Yronwood, father of Lord Anders Yronwood).</p>
<p>Legends: Prince Garin the Great (the Wonder of the Rhoyne, legendary Rhoynar prince who kept Valyria at bay but lost a quarter million Rhoynar and eventually his life to the Valyrians).</p>
<p>At a hidden well in the desert of Dorne, Arianne and her most trusted companions are awaiting the arrival of Myrcella and her sworn sword. Although Arianne has the utmost trust in Garin, Drey and Sylva, she is still unsure about Ser Gerold Dayne. She considers his cruel nature and the mystery surrounding him. Worried that Ser Arys may be wary of him and this could cause them to come to blows, she thinks, By tradition the Kingsguard were the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms... but Darkstar was Darkstar. Garin warns Arianne that he does not like the man, but she reminds him that they may need his sword and eventually his castle. Later, Darkstar tells her that this scheme to crown Myrcella will not work as she has planned. He then unsheathes his sword, and reveals that you incite a war with steel, not a gold crown.</p>
<p>When Ser Arys and Princess Myrcella arrive, Arianne introduces the girl to her companions. Myrcella recalls the great knight Ser Arthur Dayne when she meets Darkstar, which seems to upset the Knight of High Hermitage, because in his mind people always remember his cousin for his famous sword. Ser Arys draws Arianne off alone and reveals that Lord Tywin was dead, and that he had placed Rosamund and a guard loyal to Arianne as imposters of Myrcella and himself, hopefully as a disguise to last the couple of days they would need to get Myrcella beyond Prince Doran's reach. They set off at night for the Greenblood, where they will take an orphan's barge west along the river. Myrcella is confused, having been told nothing by Arys, especially the fact that everyone keeps calling her "your Grace". Arianne tells her some of their plan, that they intend to crown her Queen, because her brother Tommen was being controlled by evil councillors.</p>
<p>During the trip, Myrcella asks Garin why they call him "an orphan of the Greenblood" when he has a mother and father. He explains that it is a metaphor for their mourning the loss of their homeland, and the "mother" river the Rhoyne. They built barges along the Greenblood and hammered them together, as they did in their ancestral land, for they were never comfortable in the deserts of Dorne. As Arianne is considering her plan to crown Myrcella at Hellholt, where Ellaria Sand's father Lord Harmen Uller rules, they reach the river and spot the barge that Garin's people promised would be waiting. But as they get closer, Areo Hotah steps from the cabin with a dozen crossbowmen. Arianne yells for them to flee, while Drey recommends they yield. But Ser Arys Oakheart charges the boat, intent on protecting his two princesses at all costs. Hit with several bolts, he reaches the deck but falls to Captain Hotah's longaxe. As Arianne falls off her horse screaming "No!", she hears Myrcella shrieking, and Hotah commanding horsemen to chase after Darkstar, who fled. Arianne notices Myrcella on her hands and knees, her head in her hands and blood streaming down her arms. Then she is brought before Hotah, pleading to know how her father discovered what she planned. The Captain of the Guards responds, "Someone told. Someone always tells."

<h2>	Arya (II) {XXX}   pg 312        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Umma (cook at the House of Black and White).</p>
<p>  Every day, the Kindly Man asks Arya who she is, but when she replies "no one", he tells her that she lies. Trying to get her to forget her true self and give up her past, Arya resists. She works hard in the temple, cleaning and doing other chores. She witnesses many people entering the temple, some to light candles, others to curl up near a statue to die, and others to speak in private to the Kindly Man. When asked whose names she whispers at night, she finally admits that they are people she wants to kill, but the priest tells her that it is the Many-Faced God who determines who shall die, not her. He also finally convinces her to dispose of her possessions, and she does so with all but Needle, which she hides outside the temple under a stone. Once she has done this, the Kindly Man comes to her and tells her some of their history. The Faceless Men were older than Braavos, having started amongst the slaves working the mines beneath the volcanoes of the Freehold of Valyria. The slaves worked under the harshest of conditions, and since they came from many different nations, they all prayed to different gods. But one amongst them (although he may have actually been a noble's son or an overseer, no one knew) realized that they were all praying to one god actually- one who could set them free from their torture.
	            The Kindly Man does not finish the story, but now Arya is a novice at the temple, and her and the Waif begin to teach each other their respective languages. As Arya learns Braavosi, the Waif also teaches her how to read a lie on someone's face, and Arya discovers that the girl is actually well over thirty years old, having taken "poisons" as part of her sacrifice to become a Faceless. One day, when other priests of the Many-Faced God visit the temple, Arya asked the Kindly Man how to change her face, as Jaqen H'ghar had done. While the priest knows not the name, he tells her it takes years of prayer, sacrifice and study to accomplish what he could do. Still, Arya wishes to learn, so he tells her to begin training the muscles of her face in front of a mirror every day. The next day, the Kindly Man tells Arya that she must leave the temple for awhile, so as to learn the Braavosi tongue by being amongst them all the time. He instructs her to find a fishmonger named Brusco, but she must not reveal who she really is. Arya decides to use the name "Cat", pretending to be an orphan girl from King's Landing.

<h2>	Alayne (II) {XXIII}    pg 328        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Gilwood Hunter (called Young Lord Hunter despite his age being close to 50, Lord of Longbow Hall, eldest son of Lord Eon Hunter, brother of Ser Eustace and Ser Harlan; now one of the Lords Declarant);</p>
<p>Lord Benedar Belmore (Lord of Strongsong, bannerman of the Arryns, currently a Lord Declarant);</p>
<p>Ser Symond Templeton (the Knight of Ninestars; also a Lord Declarant);</p>
<p>Lord Horton Redfort (Lord of Redfort, father of Ser Mychel; a Lord Declarant);</p>
<p>Mela (a servingwoman at the Eyrie).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Lyonel Corbray (Lord of Heart's Home, elder brother of Ser Lyn; Lyonel supports Lord Petyr Baelish, while Ser Lyn supports the Lords Declarant; Lord Lyonel, while the eldest, did not inherit the family's Valyrian sword 'Lady Forlorn');</p>
<p>Ser Samwell Stone (Strong Sam Stone, master-at-arms of Runestone);</p>
<p>Harrold Hardyng (called Harry the Heir, a ward of Lady Anya Waynwood, recently knighted by Lord Yohn; great-nephew of Lord Jon Arryn, grandson of Lady Alys Arryn and Ser Elys Waynwood; the only surviving male heir to the Arryn line other than Lord Robert);</p>
<p>Lady Shella Whent* (dispossessed Lady of Harrenhal, left no heirs).</p>
<p>Sansa is now completely in the role of Alayne Stone, and she has considerable influence in the Eyrie. On the balcony of her rooms in the Maiden's Tower, she surveys the armies of the Lords Declarant camped outside the Gates of the Moon. Lord Gilwood Hunter had arrived first, and immediately blockaded supplies from reaching the Eyrie. Though they were not yet under siege, the situation looked dire from her standpoint. Lord Robert, even more irritable than normal, tells Alayne that he still hears Marillion singing every night. Alayne assures him that the bard was dead, although she had not seen the body, but she herself no longer heard singing. When Littlefinger arrives, he informs them that the Lords Declarant are on their way up to the Eyrie for a parley. He tells Alayne that there will be eight of them, but he is only concerned about Ser Lyn Corbray. We learn that Ser Lyn had fought against Lord Jon Arryn at the onset of Robert's Rebellion, but later fought alongside him at the Trident, where he slew Prince Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard and broke the Dornish line. While his elder brother supported Petyr's position as Lord Protector of the Vale, Ser Lyn had taken up with the Lords Declarant. Bearing the Valyrian sword 'Lady Forlorn', Ser Lyn was a dangerous and unpredictable man who was very quick to demand a duel.</p>
<p>The Lords Declarant seek to defend Lord Robert and the Vale, but do not acknowledge the Lord Protector, naming him a false counselor who had been misruling the Vale. After Robert has another fit, Littlefinger suggests that Maester Colemon try giving him sweetsleep, although the maester seems reticent to do so. Alayne tells her "father" that Lord Yohn Royce will recognize her, having met her at Winterfell when Ser Waymar took the black, but Petyr explains that "men see what they expect to see." She also asks him why he doesn't leave the Vale and take up his position as Lord of Harrenhal. Littlefinger is convinced the place is cursed, especially after what happened to Lord Tywin, Ser Gregor, and Vargo Hoat. And Lady Shella Whent had recently died without any heirs, claiming yet another family that had once ruled at Black Harren's nightmare castle. When Alayne recommends that he give Harrenhal to Lord Frey, Petyr smiles and tells her he might, but he would really like to give it to Cersei; saying, "I might have to remove her from the game sooner than I'd planned. Provided she does not remove herself first."</p>
<p>Alayne leads the Lords Declarant up to Petyr's solar, where he confounds them by agreeing to sign their declaration to weed out the false counselors. But Lord Yohn tells him they did not come to obtain his signature; they are here to remove Littlefinger and take Lord Robert to foster at Runestone. Petyr informs them that he plans to foster the sons of other lords here so that Robert will have boys his own age around. He also asks Lady Anya to send Harrold Hardyng to the Eyrie as his ward, but the Lords scoff at this request. Littlefinger refuses their demand that he vacate the Vale and turn over Robert, and after he calls their bluffs of violence, Ser Lyn Corbray laughs and says, "Littlefinger will talk you out of your smallclothes if you listen long enough. The only way to settle his sort is with steel." He draws Lady Forlorn, but this enrages the other Lords Declarant, and Bronze Yohn tells the knight, "Put up your steel, ser! Are you a Cobray or a Frey? We are guests here." Cobray stalks off, but this has worked to Littlefinger's advantage, as he now turns hostile toward the Lords. Demanding that they lift their encampment and give him one year to set the Vale to rights or else he will willingly step down as Lord Protector, all the Lords except Yohn Royce agree, and Petyr emerges victorious in the parley.</p>
<p>Later that night, after the Lords have departed, Alayne asks Petyr what he plans for the next year. Littlefinger continues his tutelage of Alayne in playing the game of thrones. He states that one or two of the older Lords may die over the course of the year, and Lord Gilwood may well be killed by his younger brother Harlan, who arranged old Lord Eon's death. Petyr reveals that he will never be able to sway Bronze Yohn, but when Alayne inquires about Ser Lyn, he tells her that he can be bought "with gold and boys and promises."
<h2>	Cersei (V)   pg 344        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Pate (whipping boy of King Joffrey and now King Tommen);</p>
<p>Noho Dimittis (representative from the Iron Bank of Braavos).</p>
<p>Cersei continues to obliviously move from one folly to the next. Angered by Tommen's brazen demand to sit on the Iron Throne and at council, she realizes that Margaery had put him up to this. Cersei refuses to give her power up for anyone, at least until Tommen comes of age. Next, she sends away the Iron Bank's envoy after telling him there will be no payment until the rebellion is ended. She receives word from Pycelle that Lord Manderly had Ser Davos beheaded, and the Freys confirmed this. Later, she speaks with Ser Osmund about his younger brother's inability to bed Margaery. Osmund swears that the young queen likes him, but that they are never alone. The kingsguard names some of those always around her, including the male singers she prefers to entertain her and her companions. </p>
<p>When Cersei crosses the yard and finds Tommen riding at the quintain, she is infuriated. Once again, this was Margaery's idea, and while all those gathered are cheering the young king's jousting ability, Cersei blunders by saying, "One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did." Margaery astutely catches this and asks what tourneys King Robert had won. The Queen Regent evades this by mentioning Robert's deeds at the Trident. She then berates Ser Loras for teaching Tommen how to ride, but the kingsguard reminds her that there has been no master-at-arms at the Red Keep since Ser Aron Santagar was killed. Walking back to her solar, she considers sending for another Dornish master-at-arms, just to irk the Tyrells.</p>
<p>In her solar, Lord Qyburn informs her that Prince Doran has imprisoned Ser Daemon Sand for demanding the release of the Sand Snakes, and that Sylva Santagar had been hastily married to the elderly Lord Eldon Estermont.  He also tells her that both Daemon Sand and Sylva were close friends of Doran's daughter Arianne. Cersei could care less, but she is interested to hear of a treasonous puppet show. She commands Qyburn to have the 4 puppeteers put to death, but Qyburn wants the females for his "experiments". Cersei had already given him Senelle, but he basically tells her she didn't last. The Queen Regent recalls the foul thing screaming in the darkness when she was down in the black cells, but grants Qyburn his test subjects. Later, as she is bathing in preparation for dinner, Jaime arrives with Tommen, who is demanding to see her. The boy king wants his horse tomorrow so that Ser Loras can continue training him, but his mother will have none of it. Jaime mocks her for suggesting that Ser Osmund is thrice the knight Ser Loras is, but Cersei finally convinces her son to wait for a new master-at-arms to be named.</p>
<p>As she gets dressed, Cersei recalls her fit of rage when her washerwoman had shrunk several of her gowns; but it is obvious she is unaware that she is actually gaining weight from all the alcohol. Her guests for dinner are Falyse Stokeworth and her husband, Ser Balman Byrch. We learn that Lady Tanda had been thrown from her horse and fractured her hip, and Cersei secretly hopes she will not recover from the wound at her age. Cersei then deftly convinces the simple-minded Falyse and Ser Balman that she fears Ser Bronn is either hiding Tyrion or gathering swords for him, and may mean to try and kill Tommen. They assure her that it was solely Bronn's responsibility for naming Lollys' bastard son Tyrion, but Balman gets the hint that Cersei would like to see the ex-sellsword disposed of, and tells her not to worry any further.</p>
<p>On her way to bed, she peeks in on Tommen and sees 3 kittens in bed with him. Ser Meryn informs her that Margaery gave them to him. That night, Cersei thinks of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and how King Aerys had blocked their betrothal out of spite. When she was 10, her father and her aunt Genna had promised she would be betrothed to Rhaegar after the tourney in Lannisport. She had been so happy that she had agreed to visit the witch Maggy the Frog with her friends. They had laughed at her prophesies, but that night King Aerys had mocked Lord Tywin for thinking he would give his son's hand to his servant Tywin's daughter. And after that, Maggy's predictions started to come true, one after another... 
<h2>	Brienne (V)   pg 363        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septon Meribald (a septon of the Riverlands without a sept; accompanies Brienne on her quest; fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings on the Stepstones);</p>
<p>Dog* (a large, faithful dog that follows Septon Meribald).</p>
<p>Returning to Maidenpool, Ser Hyle informs Lord Randyll that Brienne had killed three of the Bloody Mummers. Tarly again warns her against playing a knight, but Brienne will not give up her mission. Her and Pod meet up with Ser Hyle the next morning, and he tells them of his plan for finding Sandor Clegane. He reveals that the Hound had not joined Lord Beric, and that the Lightning Lord's band had no part in the raid on Saltpans (Lord Tarly had created this rumor in the hopes of turning the smallfolk against Lord Beric). Ser Hyle knows a septon with great knowledge of the Riverlands, and proposes that they accompany the man to Saltpans. When Brienne says she has no intention of traveling with Hunt, he tells her that he is no longer in Lord Tarly's service. They soon depart for Saltpans, while Septon Meribald talks of the gods, his past and the great bands of wolves in the Riverlands led by a demon of a she-wolf. Meribald tells them there may be broken men about on their way to Quiet Isle, and Brienne surmises that the septon himself once had such an experience before he discovered his piety.

<h2>	Samwell (III) {VIII}   pg 377        </h2>
	<u>Introduced:</u> Terro, Orbelo (two bravos);</p>
<p>The Sailor's Wife, Yna One-Eye (whores at the Happy Port);</p>
<p>Xhondo (a mate on the Cinnamon Wind, from the Summer Islands).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> The Moonshadow (a well-known courtesan in the secret city of Braavos).</p>
<p>Staying at an inn in Braavos, Sam is nearing wits' end. Dareon has abandoned them for the brothels, Gilly remains inconsolable, and Maester Aemon's health deteriorates daily. To make matters worse, Sam had spent nearly all their coin on their rooms, a healer for Aemon, and passage on a boat that they wound up unable to board due to the maester's health. Feverish and dying, the maester begs Sam to return to the docks to learn more about this rumor of dragons that Dareon had heard at some winesink. Aemon mumbles to Sam, "Dragons. The grief and glory of my house... My brothers dreamed of dragons too, and the dreams killed them, every one. Sam, we tremble on the cusp of half-remembered prophecies... I should have seen it. Fire consumes, but cold preserves. The Wall..."</p>
<p>Sam departs that night to find Dareon, but gets accosted by two bravos because he is wearing a sword. However, he is saved by Cat of the Canals, who tells him of another black brother about to wed the Sailor's Wife. Sam finds Dareon at the Happy Port, but his brother from the Watch wants nothing more to do with the black, or Gilly and Aemon for that matter. Sam punches him in the face, but gets tossed into the canal by the proprietors of the brothel. He is saved from drowning by a huge Summer Islander, who is a mate aboard the Cinnamon Wind and knows of these dragons that Sam had mentioned.

<h2>	Jaime (III) {XII}    pg 391        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Steffon Swyft (son of Ser Harys Swyft, a knight sworn to Casterly Rock);</p>
<p>Sarsfield (commanding the archers among Jaime's small army);</p>
<p>Maester Gulian (serving under Ser Bonifer Hasty);</p>
<p>Lewys Piper (called Little Lew, a squire; son of Lord Clement Piper and younger brother of Ser Marq);</p>
<p>Ser Roger Hogg (the Knight of Sow's Horn, a landed knight sworn to house Hayford);</p>
<p>Shitmouth (one of Ser Gregor's men-at-arms);</p>
<p>Ben Blackthumb (a blacksmith at Harrenhal for decades).
	            Aware that Cersei is trying to rid herself of him, Jaime argues that his place is beside the king, not off laying siege to Riverrun. But his sister responds that she can't rely on Ser Daven, and needs Jaime to defeat Ser Brynden Tully, as well as find out why Gregor's men at Harrenhal have not released Ser Wylis Manderly as the crown had requested. She states that Ser Osmund will command the kingsguard in his absence, although Jaime dislikes the idea. Jaime's command consists of Ser Kennos, Ser Dermot, Strongboar, Red Ronnet, as well as Ser Ilyn Payne and Ser Addam Marbrand, whom Jaime had demanded as concessions from his sister. On the first night, they guested at Castle Hayford, and Jaime considers the fate of his cousin Tyrek, who would be lord of the castle were he not missing. He thought it possible the boy was still alive, perhaps having been secreted off by command of Varys, who very well could have known that the riot would occur.</p>
<p>Starting that night, Ser Jaime begins training every night with Ser Ilyn, in the hopes that he can become a proficient swordsman with his left hand. Arriving at Harrenhal, Jaime has Gregor's men release all the prisoners including Wylis Manderly, and then leaves Ser Bonifer the Good to hold the castle until Petyr Baelish takes up its lordship. Jaime commands Bonifer to kill the Hound or Thoros of Myr if either are captured, but requests he send him any Bloody Mummers or Lord Beric should they fall into his hands. Outside, Jaime comes across Ronnet Connington, who mentions how he once was betrothed to Brienne. When the Knight of Griffin's Roost mocks Brienne, Jaime hits him in the face with his golden hand.

<h2>	Cersei (VI)    pg 410        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Portifer Woodwright, Ser Lucantine Woodwright (brother knights sworn to the Iron Throne);</p>
<p>Ser Bayard Norcross, Ser Courtenay Greenhill (knights sworn to the Iron Throne, often seen in Margaery and her companions' company);</p>
<p>Alyn Ambrose (a squire betrothed to Elinor Tyrell).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Russell Merryweather (only child of Lord Orton and Lady Taena).</p>
<p>Cersei and Taena share the queen's litter en route to the Great Sept of Baelor. The lady from Myr is telling Cersei about all the men who are always around Margaery, and how she was present for the bedding at Renly's wedding. Although Taena is not sure if Margaery is a maiden, she affirms that Renly was aroused. She also lets on that beside all the knights and bards, Pycelle is a frequent visitor of the young queen, and her brother Ser Loras visits perhaps more than any other. They also discuss the new High Septon, a man who was once a "sparrow" and not a member of the Most Devout. This is not only surprising, but also of concern to Cersei, and she considers that she may have to poison this new leader of the Seven, if he becomes unruly. Reaching the top of Visenya's Hill, the queen's litter can continue no further as the streets are packed with "sparrows". Continuing on foot, Cersei considers Pycelle's objection to her choice of Ser Osfryd to replace Addam Marbrand as the commander of the City Watch. She takes note of all the bones and skulls piled up around the statue of Baelor, and is told that they are the remains of septons and septas who were killed by the war, because they received no protection from the Throne. At the doors to the Great Sept, armed men block the kingsguards' entry since they bear weapons. Cersei must enter alone, and as she does she wonders about these anointed knights answering the call to defend the church.</p>
<p>Inside the Sept, she is appalled to find Septon Raynard in roughspun robes scrubbing the floors, and learns that Septon Torbert had been imprisoned for being obese when so many were starving. She berates the new High Septon, this "sparrow" wearing frayed robes and standing before her barefoot. He tells her that the Faith has sold the crown her father had given his predecessor, as well as all the valuables in their vaults, in order to help feed the poor. Cersei recalls Qyburn's report that the "sparrows" had broken down the doors of the Sept before the final vote with axes in their hands and their leader on their shoulders. She now understands how this man had been elected High Septon. Speaking in private, the priest reprimands her for beheading Ned Stark on the steps of the Great Sept, and reveals that he hasn't come to the Red Keep to bless King Tommen because he is still praying for guidance from the Seven to affirm that the boy is the rightful king. The Queen Regent begins to seethe with anger, and then makes her ultimate blunder when she concedes to his concerns that the holy men on the roads need protection from rape and murder: Cersei agrees to have Tommen rearm the Faith, something King Maegor had forbade almost 300 years ago. She promises to restore the Faith Militant and the Order of the Sword and Star, for which the High Septon would acknowledge Tommen as king and forgive the Crown's debt to the Faith.</p>
<p>Back in her litter, Cersei tells Taena of her triumph: with one stroke she had gotten the Faith to bless Tommen, reduced the Throne's debt by almost a million dragons, and cleared the city of "sparrows" by restoring the Warrior's Sons and the Poor Fellows. Yet she doesn't realize the repercussions of what she has set in motion. On the way back to the Red Keep, Cersei's litter encounters Margaery's entourage returning from a horse ride and picnic. Margaery tells Cersei that she should share some of the burden of ruling the realm. But Cersei laughs at her, especially when the young queen tells her she is always well protected by her brother Loras when she goes riding.

<h2>	The Reaver (PoV: Victarion Greyjoy)   pg 427        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ragnor Pyke, Wulfe One-Ear (two of Victarion's crewmen);</p>
<p>Ser Talbert Serry*  (heir to Lord Osbert Serry of Southshield, a knight sworn to Highgarden; slain by Victarion);</p>
<p>Lord Humfrey Hewett* (Lord of Oakenshield, bannerman to the Tyrells; killed by command of King Euron);</p>
<p>Falia Flowers (bastard daughter of Lord Hewett);</p>
<p>Lord Osbert Serry (Lord of Southshield, father of Ser Talbert).</p>
<p>Victarion Greyjoy's Iron Victory has rammed one of the longships of the Shield Islands. Victarion kills Ser Talbert Serry of Southshield, and the ironborn's massive fleet is soon victorious in their conquest of the Shield Islands which sit at the mouth of the Mander River upstream of the Port of Oldtown. It is Victarion's command that won the battle, but it will be King Euron they cheer for engineering their bold attack. Back in his cabin, as the dark-skinned woman Euron gave him tends his wounds, Victarion recalls Aeron's words that he would find a way to remove Euron from the Seastone Chair. He remembers how he had helped capture Lord Blacktyde, who had refused to acknowledge Euron, and paid for it with his life. Asha, however, had escaped the Iron Islands along with those loyal to her.</p>
<p>Landing at Lord Hewett's Town on Oakenshield, the Lord Captain meets the Reader and the Drumm. Both are worried that Euron's little conquest will bring ruin down upon them, as surely Highgarden will respond. At the feast, Victarion notes that Euron has shamed Lord Hewett and his wife and daughters. The recently crowned king then raises Ser Harras Harlaw, Andrik the Unsmiling, Lord Maron Volmark and Nute the Barber to Lords of the 4 Shield Islands, effectively stealing away Victarion's right-hand man. Euron declares that they will sail on the morrow with provisions plundered from the Shield Islands; selling the slaves they had just taken in the Free Cities on their way to find the dragons he had promised. But many of the captains object, stating that they should attack Oldtown or the Arbor, and Euron stalks from the hall. Soon, one of Euron's bastard sons tells the Iron Captain that the king wishes to see him.</p>
<p>In his room, Euron tells his brother that the Reader was correct that the whole fleet could never reach Slaver's Bay together. But he believes that the Iron Fleet alone could, and promises his brother the Seastone Chair as reward if he sails to Slaver's Bay and returns with Daenerys. Euron means to marry her and ascend to the Iron Throne. With Lord Baelor Blacktyde's words that 'Euron was maddest of them all' on his mind, Victarion agrees to go, thinking to himself, You stole my wife and despoiled her, so I'll have yours.         

<h2>	Jaime (IV) {XIII}   pg 445        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Maester Ottomore (counselor at Castle Darry);</p>
<p>Ser Harwyn Plumm (called Hardstone, commander of the garrison at Castle Darry, son of Lord Philip Plumm);</p>
<p>Garrett Paege (a squire with Jaime's unit);</p>
<p>Mariya Frey (of house Darry; widow of Merrett Frey, mother of Lady Amerei Lannister who is now the Lady of Darry; goodmother of Lord Lancel; also mother of Fat Walda and Little Walder);</p>
<p>Ser Hugo Vance (a knight sworn to the Iron Throne);</p>
<p>Ser Arwood Frey (son of Ser Hosteen Frey, grandson of Lord Walder, nephew of the late Merrett Frey).        </p>
<p>Jaime's small host reaches Castle Darry, and he finds himself contemplating the genius of his Uncle Kevan for his choice of a bride for Lord Lancel, Amerei Frey, whose mother is a Darry. The Lord Commander had dispatched Ser Ronnet to accompany Wylis Manderly to Maidenpool, but nevertheless he had too many men to be fed at his cousin's new castle. Jaime takes note of all the armed Freys and "sparrows" in the castle, far outnumbering Lannister men. Darry's maester greets Ser Jaime, surprised by this unexpected visit, and tells him that Ser Kevan departed right after the wedding, and that Lancel was praying in the sept. The maester provides him with Lancel's own room, since Jaime's cousin had taken to sleeping in the sept. As Jaime bathes before the guest feast, he notices that Josmyn Peckledon, his new squire, wishes to bed Pia. Jaime tells him to use Lancel's room for his first bedding, saying, "You'll feel a lord yourself when you're done, if Pia knows her business." But Jaime warns him to treat her kindly, perhaps due to his own guilt for refusing the girl when Qyburn had sent her during his recuperation at Harrenhal.</p>
<p>At the feast, Jaime learns that his cousin has been fasting since the old High Septon had died. Lord Lancel also does not join them for dinner. Lady Amerei begs Jaime to stay and help them defeat Lord Beric, the Hound and the other outlaws. He learns that the outlaws seem to be following a woman now, cloaked and hooded, and no one has seen Beric Dondarrion for a while. Strongboar claims to be moved by Ami's words, and promises to return after they take Riverrun to sort out the Hound. Jaime leaves the table and goes to the sept. Three armed sparrows bar his path, but Lancel lets him in. Lancel admits that his father left after they quarreled, and that he does not intend to consummate his marriage. And then he admits his greatest sins- serving the wine that resulted in King Robert's death, and that he had been sleeping with Cersei. Lancel states that he plans to forsake his title as Lord of Darry, and head to King's Landing to swear vows as a Warrior's Son. When Jaime learns that Cersei has rearmed the faith, he is almost as upset by this as he is to discover that Tyrion had not been lying about Cersei's infidelity. Later, in the yard, Jaime admits to Ser Ilyn that he would have killed Arya Stark had he found her instead of Jory Cassel. 

<h2>	Brienne (VI)   pg 460        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Brother Narbert, Brother Gillam (penitent brothers of the Quiet Isle, permitted to speak only one day out of every seven);</p>
<p>The Elder Brother (head of the monastic order at the septry on the Quiet Isle; once a knight who fought beneath Prince Rhaegar's banner).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Quincy Cox (the Knight of Saltpans, an elderly landed knight);</p>
<p>Galladon Tarth* (Brienne's brother, drowned at the age of eight; only son of Lord Selwyn the Evenstar);</p>
<p>Alysanne Tarth*, Arianne Tarth* (sisters of Brienne, both died in infancy).</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Quiet Isle, Brienne and her companions are taken up the path to see the Elder Brother. Brienne mentions to the brother guiding them that she is heading for Saltpans to kill the Hound. This takes the man aback, but he tells them to speak to their elder. They see a huge horse in their stables, obviously a war horse, who had mauled two of the brothers. And on a hill, they pass a huge cloaked novice digging graves. The man appears lame, but they cannot see his face (if this isn't Sandor Clegane, I'll eat my hat!). The Elder Brother speaks further of the horrible raid on Saltpans, made worse by the fact that Ser Quincy Cox hid behind his castle walls and did nothing to help the villagers. After dinner, the Elder Brother speaks in private with Brienne. He asks what she seeks in Saltpans, and when she mentions a highborn girl, the elder knows she refers to Sansa.</p>
<p>He lets on that it is the wrong Stark she seeks, for the Hound had captured Arya. Shocked that both of Lady Catelyn's daughters may yet be alive, she is equally surprised when he informs her that Sandor Clegane was dead. The Elder Brother had buried his corpse himself, and left the hound's-head helm on the grave. It was some other outlaw who found and wore it when they raided Saltpans. He goes on to tell her that he took pity on Sandor before he died, and would only say that "he is at rest" when she asks if he were truly dead. The elder remarks that the horse in their stables was the Hound's, Stranger. The Elder Brother then tells her that he was once a knight who fought for Prince Rhaegar at the Trident. He had taken several terrible wounds in the battle, fell in the river, yet awoke upon the shores of the Quiet Isle. He urges her not to be another casualty of this war, and return home. Brienne breaks down and cries, telling him her story, finishing with, "I have to try to save her... or die in the attempt."

<h2>	Cersei (VII)    pg 473        </h2></p>
<p>Margaery is fuming at Cersei and her council that the Throne must respond at once to the ironmen's attack on the Shield Islands. Cersei does not appreciate the young queen's tone, and claims that it must fall to Highgarden to retake "these rocks". Ser Loras interjects as his sister seethes, stating that his brothers Willas and Garlan have the men, but not the ships, to win back the islands. He requests that Cersei pull Lord Redwyne's fleet from their siege of Dragonstone, so they may return to gather troops at the Arbor. The Queen Regent denies his request, implying that the Redwyne fleet would not depart until Dragonstone fell. Knowing that Lord Paxter intended to starve them out, Ser Loras asks leave to lead the assault, and promises Cersei Dragonstone within a fortnight. Pleased by this unexpected "gift", Cersei grants him permission.</p>
<p>Returning to her apartments, Pycelle objects to her sending Loras, but Cersei is hoping the knight will die besieging the walls of Dragonstone; but if not, she would still strike a blow against Stannis. Alone with Qyburn, he mentions that he has a "champion" to replace Loras should he fall. Cersei is not so sure of Qyburn's "paragon", and informs him that the smiths she hired believe the weight of the armor he requested cannot be borne by a human. Later, in bed, Lady Taena asks her certain questions that Cersei becomes concerned the woman may report her answers to Margaery. But Taena assures her that all her secrets are safe. However, their chat is interrupted by a guard pounding on her door with word that Falyse Stokeworth begged to see her. Cersei finds the woman battered, and listens to the tale of her husband's death after he challenged Bronn to single combat. Bronn forced Ser Balman to confess who put him up to this before he killed him. Bronn then told Falyse to leave immediately or she would meet the same fate. When Falyse told her mother's guards to arrest Bronn, they laughed and told her to listen to "Lord Stokeworth". Fearful that Falyse would spread rumors of Cersei's involvement, she summons Lord Qyburn so that he could take another female subject to his lab in the black cells. Back in her room, a very inebriated Cersei contemplates how to deal with Bronn, and then begins to fondle Taena, 'claiming her rights as queen' the way Robert would do to her when he was drunk.
<h2>	Jaime (V) {XIV}   pg 487        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Daven Lannister (son of Ser Stafford Lannister, cousin to Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion; currently named Warden of the West by Cersei);</p>
<p>Lady Genna Frey (of House Lannister, wife of the recently-named Lord of Riverrun, Emmon Frey; mother of the deceased Ser Cleos and Tion; sister of Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan; aunt of Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion, Lancel, Willem, Martyn, Tyrek, and Joy Hill);</p>
<p>Ser Manfryd Yew, Ser Reynard Ruttiger (landed knights sworn to Casterly Rock).</p>
<p>Legends: The Ebon Prince (one of the chief participants in the War of the Ninepenny Kings; unsure if he was a Blackfyre or not).</p>
<p>Reaching the camps besieging Riverrun, Jaime meets with his cousin Ser Daven. The new Warden of the West spits when he discovers that it was Vargo Hoat who had Jaime's hand amputated, saying, "I told your father I would forage for him, but he refused me. Some tasks are fit for lions, he said, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs." Daven reveals how much the Freys are vexing him, and even their own uncle Emmon Frey is trying his patience, complaining that he doesn't want his new home destroyed by a siege. Worst of all is Ser Ryman, who keeps tying a noose around Edmure Tully's neck each morning threatening the Blackfish that he means to hang him. They speak of Lancel and his abandonment of Darry, to which Jaime recalls the looks on Ami's family's face when Lancel made his intentions clear. He is all too aware of how Lord Walder deals with those who break Frey marriage proposals. Daven tells the Lord Commander that their Uncle Kevan had passed through the camps heading west. He also mentions that Edmure's wife Roslin is pregnant, and oddly she is fond of the dispossessed Lord of Riverrun. And he speaks of Lord Gawen Westerling constantly hounding him to rescue his wife and children, whom are being held captive by Ser Brynden Tully. Jaime is perturbed to learn how little help they are receiving from the bannermen of the Tullys, who bent the knee to the Iron Throne after the Red Wedding. He realizes that he must secure Riverrun quickly to put down any threat of rebellion. Starving them out would take far too long.</p>
<p>         The next morning, Jaime is considering a parley with Ser Brynden, and recalls when he was a squire of Sumner Crakehall, sent to Riverrun with a message. Lord Hoster had seated Jaime next to Lysa, but the young man was far more interested in Lysa's famous uncle, the Blackfish. Within site of the walls of Riverrun, Jaime has his tent pitched, and soon after he receives a visit from his Aunt Genna and her husband, Emmon Frey. We discover very quickly that Genna is Lannister through-and-through, with the wit and sharp tongue common to all of Lord Tywin's children. Jaime lies to them that their son Cleos died bravely, and then listens to Emmon's laments about a siege damaging his castle and the fact that he was named Lord, but not Lord Paramount of the Trident. But Genna tells him to get lost so she can speak in private with her nephew.</p>
<p>Lady Genna makes it known how she feels about Cersei rearming the Faith, Cersei's choice of councillors, in particular rejecting her brother Kevan as Hand, and Lancel's fool decision to leave behind his lordship. When Jaime remarks that he plans to treat with Ser Brynden, his aunt tells him that he would be better off beheading Edmure. But Jaime feels this may further the Blackfish's resolve, and would sooner assault the walls of Riverrun if a parley won't work. At last, they discuss Lord Tywin, and Jaime asks her if she loved her eldest brother. Lady Genna tells him how it was Tywin, a boy of only ten, who objected to their lord father's decision to wed the 7-year old Genna to Emmon Frey, who was not even the heir to the Twins. For that alone, she loved him, stating, "...every little girl needs a big brother to protect her. Who will protect us now?" When Jaime insists that he is his father's son, his aunt replies, "You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg, and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak... but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you."
<h2>	Cat of the Canals (III) {XXXI}   pg 504        </h2></p>
<p>Introduced/<u>First Mentioned:</u> Brusco (a fishmonger who takes in Cat of the Canals for a time to sell his clams);</p>
<p>Brea, Talea (Brusco's daughters);</p>
<p>Blind Beqqo (another fishmonger);</p>

<p>Acclimated to the routine of Cat of the Canals, Arya is learning the Braavosi tongue and trying to learn three new things that the Kindly Man told her she must. Selling clams by day, she sleeps in bed with Brusco's daughters by night, and for three days during each black moon, she returns to the House of Black and White. She delivers all three things the Kindly Man wants her to learn, but he still sends her back to Brusco. He tells her of Him of Many Faces; especially how all religions are aware of Him, even if they don't worship Him. Even within the Seven there exists the Stranger, whom the Kindly Man reveals is Him of Many Faces. One night when the black moon began, she walked alongside Dareon after he departed the Happy Port. Arya was angered by the singer's abandonment of his vows as a black brother. Returning to Brusco's, she gives him the coin she collected selling his mollusks and a pair of new boots, then heads to the House of Black and White for three nights.</p>
<p>The Waif teaches her how to identify certain poisons like Sweetsleep and the Tears of Lys, and then tells her the full story of how she came to the temple. She claims to be the eldest child from an ancient house, but when her stepmother had a true daughter, the woman tried to poison the Waif. When her father discovered this, he delivered two-thirds of his wealth to the House of Black and White, and soon after his second wife was dead and the Waif now a servant in the temple. She reveals that she lied about part of that tale, but before Arya can guess which part, the Kindly Man visits her. She tells him the three new things she had learned, finishing with the knowledge that Dareon was dead- his throat slit and his body dumped in the canal. When the Kindly Man asks who killed him, she replies, "Arya of House Stark." The priest again asks her who she is, to which she answers, "no one". But, as always, he tells her she lies, then asks the Waif to bring Arya some warm milk to help her sleep. Arya goes to bed, but upon awakening in the morning, she discovers that she is blind...       

<h2>	Samwell (IV) {IX}    pg 519        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Kojja Mo (a red archer from the Summer Islands, daughter of Captain Quhuru Mo).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lady Rhaelle Baratheon* (Princess of House Targaryen, daughter of King Aegon V, sister of Prince Duncan the Small and King Jaehaerys II; mother of Lord Steffon Baratheon and grandmother of Robert, Stannis and Renly).</p>
<p>The Cinnamon Wind is somewhere off the coast of Dorne as Sam leads a prayer service to mourn the passing of Aemon Targaryen. Xhondo's information on the three dragons had given Maester Aemon a second wind, but it wasn't enough. Sam recalls some of the ancient maester's words during the sea voyage from Braavos, "No one ever looked for a girl. It was a prince that was promised... Rhaegar, I thought... The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female... Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke... Lady Melisandre has misread the signs. Stannis has some of the dragon blood in him, yes... Rhaelle, Egg's little girl, she was how they (the Baratheon brothers) came by it... They must send her a maester. Daenerys must be counseled, taught, protected..." Aemon begged Sam to convince the archmaesters of this, and later rambled some of the following (perhaps prophetic) lines: a glass candle that could not be lit; eggs that would not hatch; the sphinx was the riddle, not the riddler (could this be referring to Alleras the Sphinx?).</p>
<p>Gilly and Sam sit together after the eulogy, drinking rum. Gilly points out that had Aemon remained on the Wall, Melisandre might have sacrificed him for his king's blood. Jon must have known this, and sent the old maester, as well as Dalla's boy, to save them from the Red Woman's fires. Gilly then says that she will name the boy Aemon Steelsong once he reaches the age of two. Below decks, Sam and Gilly comfort each other, although he is consumed by guilt for forsaking his vows. Afterwards, Sam tries to avoid Gilly, but Kojja corners him and tells him that what he and Gilly did was considered holy in the Summer Islands, a way of honoring the dead by celebrating life. Kojja advises Sam that Gilly knows they can never be man and wife, but there was nothing wrong with them comforting each other on the long journey. Sam is persuaded, but perhaps it is because Kojja promised to throw him overboard...

<h2>	Cersei (VIII)   pg 529        </h2></p>
<p>Legends: Grand Maester Ellendor, Grand Maester Merion (Grand Maesters prior to Pycelle).</p>
<p>Lord Aurane Waters has returned from Dragonstone with news that the fortress has fallen. This was good news indeed, considering that word from the Reach mentioned the ironmen raiding the Arbor and pushing towards Oldtown. Aurane indicates that Ser Loras was grievously wounded during the assault and lay dying after having had boiling oil poured on him from the walls. Ecstatic, Cersei had to deliver the news personally to Margaery. The young queen is appalled by Cersei's description of the fate of her brother, and commands Cersei to get out of her quarters. Back in her solar, four separate men bring word on a dwarf sighting, and one brings her a head. However, none of them bear word related to Tyrion, and Cersei sends them away in frustation. Later, in court, Cersei must deal with several unimportant pleas, and then Septon Raynard arrives. Furious that the High Septon himself did not come before her, she scoffs at his words that the Faith is trying to abolish the brothels in the city.</p>
<p>Pycelle brings word that Lord Gyles may not live much longer, but Cersei demands that the Grand Maester do his utmost to keep the old man alive. At dinner with her son, Tommen mentions that Margaery has been urging him to attend court, to which Cersei responds how much she'd like to see the young queen's tongue torn out. Tommen yells at his mother, but she commands Ser Boros to chastise the boy king's whipping boy. During the night, Cersei dreams of her visit to the woods witch back when she was around 11 years old. She vividly recalls Maggy the Frog's plea that they leave her, but Cersei and Melara will not back down. Maggy commands them to cut open their thumbs, and the old easterner tastes their blood. She prophesized that Cersei would marry the king (not the Prince, as Cersei thought), but her husband would father 16 children and Cersei only three, and that she would reign as queen only "until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear... Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you." Maggy also warns that Melara will die very soon, and true enough, she drowns in a well shortly after.</p>
<p>Waking from the nightmare, she sends for Pycelle to make her a potion that permits sleep without dreams. She asks him if seeing the future is possible, but the old maester evades answering by saying, "Shouldour morrows be foretold? And to that I should answer, 'No.' Some doors are best left closed." Aggravated, she sends for Qyburn, first asking if Falyse was still capable of being used to root out Bronn. But the necromancer tells her it is too late for that. Then she inquires of him the same she had asked of Pycelle. We learn that Maggy was from the far east, and had married a wealthy merchant. Their son was "upjumped" to a petty lord by Cersei's grandfather (it is quite obvious that Maggy is Sybell Spicer's grandmother). Qyburn tells her that the name Maggy was probably a mispronunciation of "maegi",  and that bloodmagic was very powerful. The de-chained maester suggests that she already knew how to forestall the prophecy. Seizing upon this suggestion, Cersei plans a fool-proof way to have Margaery killed. Deciding that treason would work best, the next day she inquires of Ser Osmund if his brother Osney could defeat Ser Boros in single combat. He replies that it wouldn't even be a match, and wonders if Boros has commited treason. Cersei replies no, but thinks to herself: But Osney has.
<h2>	Brienne (VII)   pg 546        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Willow Heddle (younger sister of the current innkeep at the Crossroads);</p>
<p>Jon Penny, Wat, Tansy, Pate, Ben (orphans living at the inn of the Crossroads).</p>
<p>Legends: Long Jon Heddle (proprietor of the inn currently called the Inn of the Crossroads; ancestor of Masha Heddle).</p>
<p>Approaching the inn at the Crossroads, Brienne's party encounters many corpses hung from trees, all with a chunk of rock salt in their mouths. They surmise that these were some of the men responsible for the attack on Saltpans, probably hung by Lord Beric's outlaw band. Reaching the inn, they meet four girls on the porch, and the oldest addresses them. She asks for silver for a night's lodging, stating the only visitors they get are either sparrows or robbers and worse. When Ser Hyle makes an inquiry regarding her tone, the smith approaches and Brienne is nearly floored by his resemblance to Renly. Inside, Brienne plans to leave before dawn with Podrick only, although she is unsure where to go. At dinner, Septon Meribald leads a prayer, but Gendry does not participate and returns to his forge. One of the orphan boys tells the septon that it is because he worships the Lord of Light. Brienne delivers some food to Gendry and mentions his resemblance to King Robert, but they are interrupted by riders drawing near.
	            Gendry says they are friends, but when Brienne peeks out, she recognizes Biter among the seven men. The leader, wearing Clegane's hound's-head helm, threatens to kill Willow if she fires her crossbow. Brienne draws Oathkeeper and intercedes. One of the men says that they are wounded and seek only fresh horses, for they are being chased by outlaws. But the large man wearing the Hound's helm charges Brienne, remembering her well. She makes short work of him, running him through with Oathkeeper, and she whispers "Sapphires" as Rorge dies. But she is blindsided by Biter, who tackles her to the ground. The huge cannibal smashes her in the face, breaking bones, and then shatters her forearm. She hears the sounds of swords clashing in the background, but then Biter takes a bite out of her face. Her last vision is Biter's tongue sticking out, obscenely long, almost like it were a sword...
<h2>	Jaime (VI) {XV}   pg 561        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Norbert Vance (Lord of Atranta, a blind man, bannerman to the Tullys);</p>
<p>Lord Clement Piper (Lord of Pinkmaiden Castle, bannerman to the Tullys; father of Ser Marq Piper and Little Lew);</p>
<p>Ser Forley Prester (knight sworn to Casterly Rock, cousin of Lord Garrison Prester).</p>
<p>Ser Jaime and Ser Brynden face each other across the drawbridge to Riverrun, alone for a parley. The Blackfish is aware of the oath Jaime had sworn to Catelyn, but the kingsguard makes it known he does not have the Stark girls. He offers Edmure Tully in exchange for Lady Sybell and her children, but Brynden replies, "My king entrusted his queen to my keeping, and I swore to keep her safe." The Blackfish also makes it clear that he believes Lord Tywin had a hand in the Red Wedding, though that will never absolve the Freys for their "breach of all the sacred laws of hospitality." Jaime challenges the older knight to single combat, with each choosing a champion. When Brynden prods Jaime to face him himself, Jaime cannot help but rise to the bait. But the Blackfish is not so foolish as to trust that Jaime's terms would be honored. The parley over, Jaime rides back to his camp and calls his captains for a war council, resolved that he must break his vow to Lady Catelyn and lay siege to Riverrun.</p>
<p>The Lords of the Riverlands who had bent the knee to the Throne do not tolerate the Freys present at the war council. Ser Ryman was too drunk to attend, but Edwyn and Bastard Walder are present. When confronted by Lord Piper as to the condition of his son, Ser Marq, Edwyn replies that he is still being held at the Twins to ensure that Pinkmaiden is truly loyal to the Iron Throne. When Bastard Walder and Lord Clement nearly come to blows, Jaime silences them, ending the council prematurely. Summoning Ser Ilyn and Ser Lyle Crakehall, Jaime heads straight for the Frey camp. He first has Payne cut loose Edmure Tully, and when Edwyn and his father Ser Ryman come forth to protest, he warns them to keep quiet. When Ser Ryman persists, stating that he is the heir to the Crossing, Jaime punches him in the face with his golden hand. He then dismisses Ser Ryman back to the Twins, sick of the man's whoring and drinking, and takes the bladed crown that his whore wears. When Jaime names Edwyn in charge of the Freys, we get a glimpse of the contempt the man feels for his own father. Jaime also demands that Lord Walder release all the hostages that he has imprisoned at the Twins.</p>
<p>Jaime asks that Ser Ryman's singer accompany him back to his pavilion, and has his squires draw a bath for Edmure. Jaime informs Edmure that he will be returned to Riverrun forthwith, and if he yields the castle, all will end well for him. The terms are that the smallfolk can stay and serve Lord Emmon Frey, Ser Brynden will be permitted to take the black, and Edmure and his pregnant wife Roslin will be well-treated prisoners at Casterly Rock. When Edmure asks what will happen should he refuse to yield, Ser Jaime indicates that he will assault Riverrun's walls in waves, sending the ex-Tully bannermen first as fodder, then the Freys, and finally his cousin Daven's westermen, and he would demolish Riverrun and all within. As Jaime leaves the tent, commanding Ryman's singer to play the 'Rains of Castermere' for Edmure, the former Lord of Riverrun pleads, "No. Not him. Get him away from me."

<h2>	Cersei (IX)   pg 574        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hugh Clifton (one of Queen Margaery's personal guards).</p>
<p>With Pycelle prostrate before her, Cersei accuses him of letting Gyles Rosby die, because she believes he is now taking orders from Margaery. The Grand Maester denies this, explaining that he visits the young queen to give her sleeping potions, but Cersei knows otherwise. Forcing a confession from him that he also brings Margaery moon tea, she then commands him to announce that Lord Rosby's dying wish was to donate all his lands and incomes to the Crown. Lady Taena wonders how Margaery could be so foolish, but Cersei is too excited to care. She does realize that she will need more proof in order to have Margaery executed for treason, knowing that she must arrange to have the girl caught in the act. She asks Taena and her husband to bring the Blue Bard to dinner that night. During the meal, Cersei demotes Ser Harys Swyft to Lord Treasurer, and now with the position of Hand vacant, she offers the title to Lord Orton Merryweather. Lord Orton accepts, although he is notably uncomfortable during the dinner, particularly due to the presence of Margaery's favorite singer.</p>
<p>Cersei wastes little time moving on the Blue Bard, accusing him of sleeping with Queen Margaery. The singer denies it, despite Cersei smashing him in the face with his own lute; and even later in the black cells under interrogation by Qyburn. But the defrocked maester tortures the singer into submission, and they lead him to say what they want. He accuses several others of also having carnal knowledge of Margaery, and then Cersei promises that he will be allowed to take the black after he confesses in front of the court. Later, Taena persuades Cersei to name Alla as innocent, since they may be able to use her to bear witness against Margaery and her other cousins. At breakfast, Tommen mentions that Margaery would be at the Sept for Maiden's Day. Cersei then launches the final move of her crazy scheme, commanding Ser Osney to go before the High Septon and admit his sins of "bedding" Margaery, Elinor and Megga. The youngest Kettleblack agrees to do so, but states, "The best lies have some truth in 'em... to give 'em flavor, as it were." The Queen Regent then allows him to have his way with her...

<h2>	The Princess in the Tower (PoV: Arianne Martell)   pg 587        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Cedra (a young servingwoman at Sunspear who is in love with Garin);</p>
<p>Bors, Timoth (serving men at Sunspear);</p>
<p>Belandra (a servingwoman who was once a bedmaid to Lady Mellario);</p>
<p>Morra, Mellei (servingwomen sisters).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Franklyn Fowler (Lord of Skyreach, Warden of the Prince's Pass, called the Old Hawk; bannerman to the Martells);</p>
<p>Jeyne and Jennelyn Fowler (twin daughters of Lord Franklyn);</p>
<p>Lord Trebor Jordayne (Lord of the Tor, father of Myria, bannerman to Sunspear);</p>
<p>Lady Nymella Toland (Lady of Ghost Hill, bannerlady to the Martells);</p>
<p>Ser Cletus Yronwood (heir to Yronwood, son of Lord Anders; currently with Prince Quentyn Martell across the Narrow Sea);</p>
<p>Maester Kedry (maester at Yronwood, overseas with Ser Cletus and Prince Quentyn).</p>
<p>Arianne is imprisoned atop the Spear Tower, contemplating her failed scheme. She never expected someone to inform her father of the plan, nor for Hotah to intercept them, and certainly not Darkstar's unprovoked attack on Myrcella. Darkstar had escaped from Hotah's men, but he had left a terrible scar on Myrcella's face, barely missing a beheading stroke as was his apparent intent. Thinking her father would see her within a day, Arianne becomes distraught as days turn into weeks, and although servants come and go with food, none will speak to her. She considers who could have betrayed her, ponders her feelings at the loss of Ser Arys, and thinks of her close relationship with Tyene. She eventually persuades the young serving girl Cedra to deliver a letter to Lord Fowler, knowing that the girl had feelings for Garin (whom Arianne assumes is imprisoned at Ghaston Grey along with her other co-conspirators). But the next day, Cedra does not return, and Arianne never sees her again during her imprisonment.</p>
<p>After an indeterminate period of agonized waiting, Areo Hotah arrived to bring her before her father. Prince Doran asks her why, to which Arianne replies, "For the honor of our House." The Prince tells her they have not caught Darkstar, but the damage he did to Myrcella, a ward of their house, has done naught but bring the Martell's dishonor. He cautions her that a war with the Iron Throne is the last thing they need. Although the Young Dragon had written that Dorne was populous, his memoirs were written to portray himself in a better light. Prince Doran admits that Dorne is actually the least populous of the Seven Kingdoms, and could not survive open war with the Throne. He admits it was a mistake not to have had her taken prior to running off with Myrcella, but he will not reveal who betrayed her. When he tells her that she disappoints him, Arianne retorts, "You have been disappointing me for years, Father." </p>
<p>Prince Doran discloses that none of her co-conspirators are imprisoned. Instead, he has sent Ser Andrey Dalt to Norvos to serve Arianne's mother; Garin is in Tyrosh for two years; and Sylva was sent to Greenstone to marry Lord Estermont. He goes on to remark that Arianne and her cousins may get the war they wanted, as Ser Balon Swann was on his way to Sunspear. The Prince had several of his bannermen stalling him, but eventually Ser Balon would discover that his brother in the kingsguard, Ser Arys, was dead and that Myrcella was maimed. Arianne continues to taunt her father, and he cautions her that he is out of patience. But the princess is unimpressed, remarking, "For Lord Tywin you always had the forbearance of Baelor the Blessed, but for your own blood, none." He responds, "You mistake patience for forbearance. I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of Elia and her children."</p>
<p>When Arianne tells him that she wants her rights to Dorne, Prince Doran finally reveals that she will have the kingdom when he passes. Arianne divulges that she knew of his scheme to make Quentyn his heir, but her father tells her that he had other plans for her. He had offered her hand to old men because he knew she would rebuke them, but he had to be seen as trying. All along, he had promised her to Prince Viserys, but now that the last male Targaryen was dead, he had no reason to deny her her right to Dorne. He finishes by saying, "We princes make our careful plans and the gods smash them all awry." His original plan was to send her to Tyrosh to serve as the Archon's cupbearer, where she could meet her betrothed in secret, while her brother Quentyn was being bred to assume the seat of their House. Finally he reveals why her brother is overseas, "to bring us back our heart's desire". When Arianne asks what that is, her father replies, "Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood." [For those who have forgotten, these are the words of House Targaryen!]

<h2>	Alayne (III) {XXIV}   pg 605        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Terrance Lynderly (eldest son of Lord Jon Lynderly [Lord of the Snakewood]; squire to Lord Robert Arryn);</p>
<p>Gyles Grafton (youngest son of Lord Gerold Grafton [Lord of Gulltown]; squire to Lord Robert);</p>
<p>Ossy, Carrot (mule handlers at Sky who work under Mya Stone);</p>
<p>Ser Byron, Ser Morgarth (two hedge knights currently in the employ of Lord Petyr Baelish).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Jasper Arryn* (Lord of the Eyrie prior to Lord Jon, father of Jon, Alys and Ronnel Arryn);</p>
<p>Alys Arryn* (sister of Lord Jon Arryn, married Ser Elys Waynwood, begot eight girls and one boy who died at age 3; her youngest daughter married a Hardyng and gave birth to Harrold  before dying);</p>
<p>Ser Elys Waynwood* (uncle of Lady Anya, husband of Lady Alys Arryn, grandfather of Harry the Heir).</p>
<p>Legends: Ser Artys Arryn (the Winged Knight, mythological hero from the Vale who drove out the First Men and flew to the top of the Giant's Lance to kill the Griffin King).</p>
<p>Alayne has been trying to coax a petulant Lord Robert to get dressed for the long descent to the Gates of the Moon. With winter fast approaching, the high seat of the Arryns will soon become inhospitable, and the entire staff is retreating for the valley floor. Her "father" was away at the wedding of Lord Lyonel Corbray, who supported the Lord Protector along with several other Vale lords, including, just recently, Lord Benedar Belmore. Maester Colemon is concerned that Robert is being given Sweetsleep too often, as it is poisonous over time. However, he sees no other choice to get the boy down the mountain without a seizure. After riding the basket down to Sky, Alayne and the rest of the household begin their descent on mules led by Mya Stone. Accompanying them is Lady Myranda Royce, Lord Nestor's daughter.</p>
<p>Randa is a natural gossip, and tells Alayne that Lady Waynwood and Ser Symond Templeton both showed at Lord Corbray's wedding, and also that Riverrun had yielded, but not Dragonstone or Storm's End. Alayne is careful with her words around the very clever Randa, although she stumbles when the woman mentions that Lord Eddard's bastard now commands the Night's Watch. She discloses that Harry the Heir was recently knighted at a tourney, but Myranda doesn't like him because Lady Waynwood had denied Lord Nestor's attempt to marry Randa to Harry. She also lets on that he has a bastard daughter despite his young age. Their banter turns to Mya and how her beloved Ser Mychel Redfort recently married one of Lord Yohn's daughters. Alayne reveals that Ser Lothor Brune likes Mya, but doesn't believe that the bastard daughter of Robert Baratheon is aware.</p>
<p>After a rough stretch crossing a gorge, where Alayne had to carry a shaking Robert across, the party reaches the Gates of the Moon. She discovers that her "father" has returned from the east, and she goes to see him immediately. Lord Petyr is entertaining three hedge knights he recently hired for his household, one of whom is none other than Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen. Dismissing them, Petyr imparts word of Cersei's spiraling downfall, saying, "It is quite vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but... it is a good thing that I thrive on chaos. What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear." But he will not explain what he meant by "three" queens. Petyr then announces that he has a present for her- a marriage contract to Harry the Heir. He tells her that she must first win his approval before they are even betrothed, hopefully giving them enough time for Tyrion to perish, allowing her to marry again. Lady Waynwood agreed to the proposal because despite Alayne's "low" birth, she is nonetheless the daughter of the Lord Protector; not to mention that House Waynwood is heavily in debt (much of it now owed to Littlefinger).</p>
<p>When Alayne asks how the young knight could be Lady Anya's heir when she has two sons, he tells her that Harry is actually Lord Robert's heir. He explains that Lord Jon Arryn's sister had married a Waynwood, and her only son perished at age three. But their youngest daughter married a knight of house Hardyng, who are landed knights sworn to Ironoaks, and begot a son, Ser Harrold Hardyng. Beside Lord Robert, he is the only living male heir to the Arryns, since he is Lord Jon's great-nephew. When Alayne learns this truth, she utters, "If Robert were to die..." To which Lord Petyr replies, "When Robert dies, Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn's bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their Young Falcon... and when they come together for his wedding, and you come out... clad in a maiden's cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the back... why, every knight in the Vale will pledge his sword to win you back your birthright. So those are your gifts from me, my sweet Sansa... Harry, the Eyrie, and Winterfell."


<h2>	Brienne (VIII)    pg 628        </h2>
	<u>Introduced:</u> Jeyne Heddle (called Long Jeyne, elder sister of Willow; innkeep of the Inn at the Crossroads, loyal to Lady Stoneheart's outlaws).</p>
<p>Brienne fluctuates between a fever dream and semi-consciousness, as the Outlaws transport her severely injured body to Lady Stoneheart. While she is being treated by Jeyne Heddle, Brienne learns that Biter is dead, skewered through the head by a spear wielded by Gendry. Lem, now wearing Sandor's steel dog helm, tells her that Stoneheart wants her hanged for her "crimes". Brienne fully awakens in a cave, where she meets Thoros of Myr. The red priest is a ghost of his former self, and he informs her about the current state of the former brotherhood without banners: "Lord Beric's fire has gone out of this world... A grimmer shadow leads us in his place... War makes monsters of us all."</p>
<p>Before long, Brienne is brought before Lady Stoneheart, where she as well as Pod and Ser Hyle will be judged. Brienne cannot see Stoneheart's face, but notices her holding a bronze crown ringed by iron swords. A northman, most likely Harwin, places Oathkeeper before Stoneheart, along with Brienne's writ signed by King Tommen. The outlaws see this as irrefutable proof that the Maid of Tarth is about Lannister business. Her words are wasted here, as her pleas of innocence fall on deaf ears. Finally, Lady Stoneheart speaks, needing to place her hand over her throat in order to gurgle out her judgment. Upon removing her hood, Brienne is horrified to discover that the Hangwoman is actually Lady Catelyn Stark, albeit now a specter from the grave. Thoros reveals that it was Lord Beric himself who administered the kiss of life to her, finally extinguishing his own unnatural life.</p>
<p>Stoneheart gives Brienne an ultimatum: kill Ser Jaime Lannister or be hanged. When the Maid states that she will not make that choice, the thing that had been Catelyn Stark orders them hanged. Despite Ser Hyle's pleas for mercy, and Podrick's stoicism, nooses are looped about all three of their necks. As they are hiked upward, thrashing and dying, Brienne screams out a word...

<h2>	Cersei (X)    pg 642        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septa Moelle, Septa Unella, Septa Scolera (septas of the Most Devout serving at the Great Sept of Baelor);</p>
<p>Ser Theodan Wells (an annointed knight now known as Ser Theodan the True; a knight serving the newly rearmed Faith);</p>
<p>Humfrey Waters (former captain of the Dragon Gate, now Commander of the Gold Cloaks).</p>
<p>Accompanied by six newly reinstated Warrior's Sons, Septa Moelle brings word to the court that Queen Margaery and her cousins have been imprisoned at the Great Sept for adultery and high treason. The Septa reveals that Margaery's maidenhead is not intact, to which Cersei thinks, I do hope the little queen enjoyed those rides of hers. Grand Maester Pycelle also reluctantly discloses that Margaery has had him mix moon tea on many occasions. Leaving the throne room confident that Margaery was finished, Cersei agrees with Aurane Waters' request to launch his new dromonds, in case Lord Mace Tyrell decided to march on King's Landing to save his daughter. Lord Orton Merryweather remarks, "This High Septon may want to try the queen himself, as the Faith once tried men of old." To this, Cersei thinks, I hope so.</p>
<p>Cersei has Tommen sign some blank warrants, which she then affixes names to. Summoning Ser Osfryd, she orders him to arrest Ser Tallad, the Blue Bard, Hugh Clifton, Mark Mullendore, as well as the Redwyne twins whom she wants to be found innocent of the charges of bedding Margaery. The next morning, Cersei and Taena are carried by litter to the Great Sept. On the way, Lady Merryweather inquires, "What if Margaery demands that her innocence be determined by battle?" Cersei smiles, and replies that she must be championed by a knight of the Kingsguard, but since Ser Osmund is brother to one of her accusers, that leaves only Ser Meryn Trant and Ser Boros Blount. Cersei states that the former will not be feeling well when the time comes. Within the Sept, the High Septon grants Cersei permission to visit her good-daughter, while Taena goes to speak with Margaery's cousins.</p>
<p>Margaery is beside herself, stripped of her clothes as well as her dignity, while she is asked to confesss her fornications every hour. Cersei tells her that she has rounded up all those that Ser Osney named, lying that they will reveal her innocence. When Cersei says that a sworn brother of the Kingsguard will fight for her should it come to a trial by combat, Margaery demands that her own brother, Ser Garlan the Gallant, be summoned to fight in place of the grievously injured Ser Loras. Cersei would never allow this to happen; and Margaery, well aware of Cersei's intentions, sneers, "Leave me. Will you make me call my gaolers and have you dragged away, you vile, scheming, evil bitch?"</p>
<p>Cersei is then escorted deep beneath Visenya's Hill to speak with the High Septon. He tells her that seven will sit in judgment of Margaery and her cousins, as the Faith had done in yore before King Jaehaerys the Conciliator stripped them of this power. When Cersei asks to have Ser Osney released into her custody, the priest flatly denies her. Chained to the ceiling of his cell, Osney has been brutally whipped. Infuriated, Cersei tells the High Septon that Osney came of his own free will. The holy man responds, "I have heard many men confess, but seldom have I heard a man so pleased to be so guilty... The more diligently we applied the scourge, the more Ser Osney's offenses seemed to change. He would now have us believe that he never touched Margaery Tyrell." When asked now if he had carnal knowledge of the queen, Osney points at Cersei, saying, "Aye. That one there." Furthermore, he confesses that Cersei ordered him to kill the old High Septon. Upon hearing this, Cersei bolts from the cell, racing headlong through the Great Sept. Fearing what may happen should the Faith question Taena Merryweather, she is soon overtaken by a group of septas, who strip her and confine her to a grim cell.</p>
<p>Her screams going unheard, Cersei begins to shiver from the cold. Every time she begins to fall asleep, she is jostled awake and asked if she will confess her sins. After two days of this torture, Qyburn enters her cell. Begging him to take her home, the de-chained maester states, "That will not be allowed. You are to be tried before a holy court of seven, for murder, treason, and fornication." He reveals that Margaery will be tried by the same court, and that he delivered the Blue Bard to the High Septon, but despite the Faith's torture, "he is still singing the same sweet song we taught him". Qyburn then informs her of the rapid changes made since her fall: the realm is now being governed by Ser Harys Swyft and Pycelle; they removed Ser Osfryd as Commander of the gold cloaks and Qyburn from the small council (though he still works for them thanks to his control of Varys' whisperers); Lord Orton and Taena have fled to Longtable, while Ser Kevan has been sent for to take over the Regency. Perhaps worst of all, Aurane Waters unshipped his oars and sailed the fleet, possibly to join Lord Stannis; while Lord Mace Tyrell and Lord Randyll Tarly were marching on King's Landing.</p>
<p>Hopeless despite Qyburn's words that his unbeatable "champion" is ready, Cersei knows that only a Kingsguard can defend her in a trial by combat. She then has Qyburn pen her final plea (and blunder) to her brother: "Come at once. Help me. Save me. I need you as I have never needed you before. I love you. Come at once."

<h2>	Jaime (VII) {XVI}   pg 658        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Gawen Westerling (Lord of the Crag, bannerman to the Lannisters; husband of Lady Sybell, father of Queen Jeyne Stark, Ser Raynald, and Rollam).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Joy Hill (bastard daughter of Gerion Lannister, cousin of Ser Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion).</p>
<p>Emmon Frey, now Lord of Riverrun in fact as well as name, demands Edmure Tully's head. Ser Jaime will not accede, though he is sorely tempted since Edmure had betrayed his concessions by helping his uncle, Ser Brynden, to escape the castle when he turned it over to the Lannisters. Despite a massive search for Lord Hoster's brother, Jaime knew the Blackfish would not be found, nor would he abandon the fight. Before being escorted west to Casterly Rock as a noble prisoner, Ser Edmure speaks his mind, "You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room, Kingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you."</p>
<p>Later, Lady Sybell Westerling and her daughter, the widowed Queen Jeyne Stark, are brought before Jaime. Jeyne is defiant of her mother, and when Sybell moves to slap her, Jaime intervenes and kindly asks Jeyne to leave the solar. Lady Sybell asks Jaime to inquire after her son, Ser Raynald, who accompanied Robb to the Twins. She then mentions that Lord Tywin promised a high-born marriage for him, "that Raynald should have joy of him". When Jaime states that Joy is his uncle Gerion's natural daughter, Sybell shouts, "You want a Westerling to marry a bastard?" Jaime retorts, "No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch. Your daughter is worth ten of you, my lady. You'll leave with Edmure and Ser Forley on the morrow. Until then, you would do well to stay out of my sight." He then contemplates how much Lord Gawen knew of his wife's schemes.</p>
<p>The following morning, Jaime warns Ser Forley Prester to guard Ser Edmure well. The knight is aware of his orders to kill Edmure should he try to slip away. Jaime adds that he should do the same for Jeyne Stark, stating, "She's twice as dangerous as Edmure, if she were ever to escape us." Jaime then visits Edwyn Frey, who is preparing his army to return to the Twins. Edwyn divulges that his father, Ser Ryman, along with his entire retinue, were hanged by Lady Stoneheart near Fairmarket. Although Edwyn blames Jaime, the Lord Commander is well aware that Edwyn could care less that his father was dead. And although Edwyn was now heir to the Twins, Jaime knew that Black Walder would probably soon move to kill his brother. Jaime takes his leave after inquiring about Ser Raynald's fate. Apparently, Queen Jeyne's brother was responsible for loosing Grey Wind on the Freys, and was shot full of quarrels before diving into the river.</p>
<p>Content that he had taken Riverrun without having to take up arms against the Tullys or Starks, Jaime later agrees to allow Ser Desmond Grell and Ser Robin Ryger to take the black, commanding Raff the Sweetling to escort them to Maidenpool. During Lord Emmon's speech to the people of Riverrun, Jaime speaks with the singer he had earlier taken from Ryman Frey. He reveals himself as Tom of Sevenstreams, and tells Jaime that he hopes to play for Lady Genna and Lord Emmon over the winter! That night, Jaime dreams of his mother, Lady Joanna, whom he barely remembered, but the dream disturbed him when his mother cried and asked him who he really was. When morning arrived, Maester Vyman delivers Cersei's message written by Qyburn. The old maester asks if Jaime wished to respond, but the Kingsguard hands the letter to Peck, saying, "No. Put this in the fire."
<h2>	Samwell (V) {X}    pg 672        </h2></p>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Gunthor Hightower (third eldest son of Lord Leyton, harbormaster of Oldtown; studied at the Citadel for several years);</p>
<p>Lorcas (an acolyte who has taken 50 years to forge nine links, in service to the Seneschal of the Citadel);</p>
<p>Archmaester Marwyn (called Marwyn the Mage, and also the Mastiff; wrote the Book of Lost Books; his ring, rod and mask are constructed of Valyrian steel; named by Mirri Maz Duur as one of her teachers in the shadow lands by Asshai; currently en-route to Slaver's Bay to help Daenerys).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Malora Hightower (the Mad Maid, eldest daughter of Lord Leyton, and always at his side);</p>
<p>Ser Garth Hightower (called Greysteel, second son of Lord Leyton, brother [or half-brother] of Baelor, Malora, Lady Alerie Tyrell, Lynesse, Ser Gunthor and Ser Humfrey);</p>
<p>Ser Humfrey Hightower (youngest child of Lord Leyton, in Lys recruiting sellsails);</p>
<p>Archmaester Norren (previous Seneschal over the past two turns, his ring, rod and mask made of electrum);</p>
<p>Archmaester Theobald (current Seneschal of the Citadel, his ring, rod and mask are lead).
	Legends: Gorghan of Old Ghis (wrote of the treacherous nature of prophecy).</p>
<p>Finally nearing Oldtown, the Cinnamon Wind has evaded or drove off the longships of the ironmen, and is undergoing customs inspection. The ironborn now control many of the outlying towns and fortifications surrounding the Arbor and along the Mander nearly to Oldtown. Sam learns that even Oldtown is at risk until Lord Paxter Redwyne can bring his fleet back from Dragonstone. Meanwhile, Lord Leyton Hightower has not left his tower in years, while his sons struggle to protect the great city. His youngest son, Ser Humfrey, has sailed to the Free Cities to hire sellsails or persuade his half-sister Lynesse to loan him some of the Archon of Lys' ships. As Sam prepares to disembark for the Citadel, he considers whether it would be safe for Gilly at Horn Hill, since it would only have a small regiment of guards left. Fortunately, Sam knows that Gilly will be safe aboard the Cinnamon Wind, at least until he can learn more of the situation in Oldtown.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Seneschal's Court, Sam is forced to wait a long while before he will be admitted to speak with the Seneschal. His patience running thin at the delay, Sam is approached by Alleras, who informs him that it will take a penny to get past the acolyte. But when Alleras introduces himself, Sam is taken aback when he learns that the acolyte is called "the Sphinx". Samwell then tells Alleras the story of how he reached Oldtown, leaving out only the promises he was sworn to keep. After hearing all that had transpired, especially Maester Aemon's plea that the Citadel learn of Daenerys, Alleras tells him to forget the Seneschal. The Archmaesters will believe little of what Sam has to say, but there is one who will- Archmaester Marwyn. At the Isle of Ravens, Sam recognizes Leo Tyrell, but before many words can be exchanged, Marwyn the Mage appears and ushers Sam and Alleras into his chambers.</p>
<p>Marwyn first describes how the Valyrians used dragonglass for various magical means, noticing Sam's interest in the Obsidian candle. Sam then repeats what he had told Alleras, stating that Maester Aemon was convinced that Daenerys was the promised one in the prophecy, not Prince Rhaegar or Stannis. To this, Archmaester Marwyn reveals how fickle and treacherous prophecy can be, but he is still intrigued. He makes it clear to Sam that Maester Aemon may have been killed by the Archmaesters had he spoken his mind to them. When Sam inquires why, Marwyn replies, "Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can."</p>
<p>Commanding Alleras to look after Sam, Marwyn makes known his plan to travel to Slaver's Bay, as Maester Aemon had intended. He intends to take the Cinnamon Wind, hoping to reach Daenerys prior to the "grey sheep", as he referred to the other archmaesters. He advises Sam to work rapidly toward his collar, and never mention anything of prophecies, dragons, or Daenerys to anyone in the Citadel. Marwyn quickly departs, and Alleras reveals to Sam that their meeting was not happenstance. The Mage knew Sam was coming, supposedly from the dragonglass candle. The novice in the room the whole time shows Sam to his quarters, finally divulging his name, "I'm Pate, like the pig boy."</p>
