	<h2>Prologue (Point-of-View: Maester Cressen)</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Maester Cressen* (Dragonstone's maester, once maester to Lord Steffon Baratheon at Storm's End, raised Robert, Stannis and Renly);</p>
<p>Lord Stannis Baratheon (Lord of Dragonstone, now proclaimed as King, held Storm's End for a year while besieged during the war 15 years before; defeated the Iron Fleet during Balon Greyjoy's Rebellion; prior master of ships on King Robert's small council, brother of Robert and Renly);</p>
<p>Melisandre (the Red Woman, a priestess of the god R'hllor and shadowbinder of Asshai);</p>
<p>Maester Pylos (young maester of the Citadel sent to replace old Maester Cressen);</p>
<p>Shireen (daughter of Lord Stannis and Lady Selyse);</p>
<p>Patchface (a fool, only survivor when Lord Steffon's ship went down);</p>
<p>Lady Selyse (now Queen, of House Florent);</p>
<p>Ser Davos Seaworth (the Onion Knight, Davos Shorthand, former smuggler, knighted by Lord Stannis, captain of Black Betha, later Lord of the Rainwood and Hand of King Stannis);</p>
<p>Lord Ardrian Celtigar (Lord of Claw Isle, bannerman to King Stannis);</p>
<p>Lord Monford Velaryon* (Lord of the Tides, Master of Driftmark, bannerman to King Stannis, his house of ancient Valyrian blood);</p>
<p>Lord Duram Bar Emmon (Lord of Sharp Point, 14 years old, bannerman to King Stannis);</p>
<p>Ser Axell Florent (Castellan of Dragonstone, uncle of Queen Selyse);</p>
<p>Lord Guncer Sunglass* (Lord of Sweetport Sound, bannerman to King Stannis);</p>
<p>Salladhor Saan (Lysene captain, self-styled Prince of the Narrow Sea, later Lord of Blackwater Bay).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Steffon Baratheon* (former Lord of Storm's End, father of Robert, Stannis and Renly, died when his ship sank returning from Volantis).</p>
<p>Maester Cressen is looking at the blood-red comet in the sky over Dragonstone, and considering whether it is an omen. A white raven had arrived from the Citadel, and it meant that the long summer was coming to a close, a summer that lasted just over 10 years. Shireen comes to visit the old maester with her fool Patchface. Shireen's face is disfigured from a bout of greyscale as a child, that Maester Cressen was not able to treat sufficiently to prevent scarring. Shireen has been having nightmares of dragons come to eat her, and Cressen explains that Dragonstone was the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of Valyria. While they are talking, Patchface begins singing "the shadows have come to dance (or stay) my lord", which Shireen says he has been singing all the time lately. Cressen remembers how Lord Steffon Baratheon found the fool while off in Volantis looking for a wife for Rhaegar at the behest of King Aerys. As they returned to Storm's End, the ship sank killing everyone aboard, but Patchface washed up on shore 3 days later, and appeared dead. His skin was clammy cold, yet he coughed up water and lived, although he was broken in mind and body.</p>
<p>Cressen then learns that Ser Davos had returned last night and was in council with the king. Cressen is disturbed, because he was always asked for his counsel in these matters, but the king was ignoring him. Cressen goes to Stannis, and on the way meets Ser Davos. The Onion Knight tells him that all the Stormlords spurned him, for they had no love for Stannis and would not join his cause. Instead, they all supported Renly along with the Lords of the Reach. We learn Davos' history, how he had been a notorious smuggler, but during the siege of Storm's End he had saved the defenders by sailing past the Redwyne blockade in the dead of night and brought onions to Lord Stannis' men. It had allowed them to survive, when they would have starved, until Lord Eddard lifted the siege. Stannis had knighted Davos for his deed, but also chopped off all the fingers on his left hand but the thumb for his previous misdeeds as a smuggler.</p>
<p>Cressen learns of Renly being named king, and worries for him. Cressen raised all three Baratheon children and grieves for them all. Davos says that Stannis has no hope with such a small army, yet the king will not relent and plans to sail against King's Landing. Cressen then goes in to give counsel to Stannis, and we learn how the king has felt slighted all these years that Renly was given Storm's End by their brother when by rights it should have been Stannis'. Cressen advises that Stannis join with Renly, but the King will not treat with Renly as long as his brother calls himself a king. He also advises that Stannis send Shireen to foster on the Eyrie to make alliance with the Arryns (and we learn that Lord Arryn had planned to foster Robert Arryn on Dragonstone with Stannis). The suggestion is overheard by Queen Selyse, who storms in and yells at the Maester for advising that Stannis needs help for the war. The Queen is wholly gone over to the god R'hllor of the red priestess Melisandre. The Queen believes the comet is an omen from the heart of fire, the god R'hllor who will aid Stannis in his conquest. Stannis is more interested in men than in the help of a god. When Selyse suggests that if Renly were to die, his army would join Stannis, Cressen is horrified and pleads with Stannis that fratricide is evil.</p>
<p>Cressen is sent away, and back in his chambers realizes that he must kill Melisandre before she can totally convert the King to her evil schemes. Cressen prepares a crystal that he plans to put in Melisandre's drink, but then oversleeps. He enters the Great Hall to find Stannis and his bannermen at the feast table. Cressen is mocked by Melisandre and Patchface because he tripped, but is given a seat by Ser Davos. Davos tells the maester that Melisandre has seen victory in her flames, but Cressen tells the red woman that her god holds no power here. Cressen then proposes a toast, and both he and Melisandre drink the poisoned wine. The ruby at Melisandre's throat glows, and she tells Cressen that R'hllor does have power here, as Maester Cressen dies from the poison.</p>

<h2>Arya (I) {VI}  pg 22/30</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lommy Greenhands* (an orphan boy bound for the Wall);</p>
<p>Hot Pie (another orphan boy, later a cook in Harrenhal, then runaway with Arya).</p>
<p>Arya is with Yoren and his recruits bound for the Wall, most of them criminals and orphans. Yoren cut her hair, told her to pretend to be a boy, and named her Arry. Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands mock her and her sword, and she finally loses control and attacks Hot Pie. After beating him senseless, Yoren drags her off and whips her. He then tells her that Lord Eddard was supposed to take the black. Before leaving King's Landing, a man came to him with a boy (obviously Gendry), some gold and a message that Lord Eddard was to take the black (Yoren does not reveal who the message was from nor whom the messenger was). That is why Yoren was waiting there near Arya, but something went wrong and Eddard was killed. Gendry calls the comet "the Red Sword", and Arya thinks of it as her father's sword Ice with the tail her father's blood.</p>

<h2>Sansa (I) {VII}   pg 28/38</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lady Tanda Stokeworth (a lady of the court);</p>
<p>Falyse (Lady Tanda's elder daughter and heir);</p>
<p>Lollys (daughter of Lady Tanda, after being raped during the uprising in the streets of King's Landing she marries the ex-mercenary Ser Bronn);</p>
<p>Lady Ermesande Hayford (an infant child; later married to Tyrek Lannister);</p>
<p>Morros Slynt (eldest son and heir of Lord Janos Slynt).</p>
<p>Ser Arys Oakheart escorts Sansa to the tourney on Joffrey's name day. Ser Arys is the only Kingsguard who objected when Joff commanded him to hit her, and even when he did, he never hit her hard. Sansa also thinks of how Joff never commands the Hound to hit her. When Sansa joins Joff he informs her that Viserys Targaryen is dead. The jousting begins, but it is a pitiful tourney as most of the great knights are off at war or in open treason against Joff. When Ser Dontos Hollard is called to face Lothor Brune, he comes out drunk and half naked. The King commands he be drowned in wine, but Sansa tells him no. She quickly makes up a story that it is a curse to take a man's life on your name day. Joff doesn't believe her, but the Hound comes to her rescue, telling Joff, "What a man sows on his name day, he reaps throughout the year." Joff then agrees with Sansa's suggestion that he make Dontos a fool and spare his life. Joff calls off the tourney in disgust, but he allows Tommen to ride against a quintain. As the prince is jousting, Tyrion and his clansmen arrive at King's Landing. He gives his condolences to Sansa for the loss of her father, and Sansa offers her apologies for Tyrion being taken captive by her mother. Tyrion responds by saying, "A great many people are sorry for that, and before I am done, some may be a deal sorrier." When Tyrion tells her she is as loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves, Sansa slips and says "lions", but only Tyrion heard her, and gently takes her arm and tells her he intends her no harm.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (I) {X}   pg 39/53</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Vylarr (Captain of the Queen's Household guards).</p>
<p>Tyrion arrives outside the council chambers, and has to threaten Ser Mandon Moore in order to get in. He shows the Queen their father's letter proclaiming Tyrion Hand of the King. Tyrion notices Littlefinger's dagger, and thinks to himself he has to have a talk with Lord Baelish, and soon. Cersei is disturbed by Tyrion's presence, and rants that her father should have returned with his army. Tyrion asks for a word alone with his sister, and as the other counselors leave, Littlefinger tells Tyrion that the Tower of the Hand is cursed due to the death of the last two Hands. Tyrion then gives him a history lesson, that 2 other Hands of King Aerys also died there, and two others were exiled, with only his father Lord Tywin leaving intact.</p>
<p>Alone, Tyrion tells Cersei he has a plan to rescue Jamie, which softens her somewhat. Tyrion learns that Cersei does not have Arya captive, only Sansa. He then asks her if she trusts the small council, because their father does not. All their counsel during Joff's short reign has led to follies and disasters. He learns that Joff was instructed to allow Eddard Stark to take the black, but Joff took it upon himself to have Lord Eddard killed. Cersei tells him it was Littlefinger's idea to name Janos Slynt a lord, another foolish move in Tyrion's eyes. He also learns that it was Varys who suggested that Ser Barristan be removed from his post as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Ser Barristan slew two of Janos' gold cloaks while leaving the city. Tyrion warns her what the smallfolk will do if they see Ser Barristan the Bold leading Robb Stark's or Renly's army. Cersei says she hadn't thought of that, and Tyrion tells her that their father did, and that is why Lord Tywin sent him. Tyrion tells her Joff might be more inclined to listen to him if he feels threatened, something Joff doesn't feel with his mother. Tyrion then tells Cersei that he is hers, and will do nothing without her consent. When he asks Cersei who killed Jon Arryn, Cersei tells him she doesn't know, and that Eddard Stark asked her the same thing, hinting that Jon Arryn suspected her of... incest, Tyrion finishes for her, earning himself a slap in the face. Tyrion tells her he knew all along, and that he is not as blind as their father. Cersei tells him how they killed King Robert, by Lancel giving him wine three times the normal potency before he faced the boar. Tyrion takes his leave, and asks Vylarr, his sister's guard captain, to escort him to the Broken Anvil. Tyrion commands Vylarr to have the heads removed from the spikes on the wall and given to the silent sisters.</p>
<p>As they ride through the city, Tyrion notices the effect the war is having on the people. Vylarr tells him that very little food is coming into the city, but the Queen has had the City Watch tripled, has a thousand laborers building catapults and other defenses, and the Alchemists' Guild has pledged ten thousand jars of wildfire. When Tyrion enters the brothel to visit Shae, he finds Varys already there. Varys tells Tyrion that he had a sudden urge to meet his young lady. Varys calls the comet "the Red Messenger" and says it comes as a herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow. Varys then poses a riddle to Tyrion, of a king, a priest and a rich man who each command a sellsword to kill the other two. Varys asks Tyrion who lives and who dies, and then takes his leave. Shae says it is the rich man who lives, but Tyrion is not so sure, saying it depends on the sellsword.</p>

<h2>Bran (I) {VIII}   pg 52/70</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Farlen* (Kennelmaster of Winterfell);</p>
<p>Gage* (cook at Winterfell);</p>
<p>Hayhead* (Winterfell guardsman);</p>
<p>Little Walder (only son and fourth child of Merrett Frey, ward of Lady Catelyn);</p>
<p>Big Walder (eldest son of Ser Jammos Frey [second son of Lord Walder and his fourth wife], also a ward of Lady Catelyn);</p>
<p>Palla* (a kennel girl).</p>
<p>Bran has been dreaming often of wolves, dreams where he is Summer and he and his brother hunt. Old Nan had told Bran that the Starks had wolf blood, though it is stronger in some that in others. Bran had asked Osha why the direwolves howled, and she told him, "They know truths the grey man has forgotten" (meaning Maester Luwin). Old Nan told him the comet foretold of dragons. Ser Rodrik had confined the direwolves in the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder. The two Walders, wards of his lady mother, were problems, and during a game, Little Walder had seemed to hurt Rickon, causing Shaggydog's attack. Bran wonders why the direwolves are howling now, and who it is they are mourning: his brother Robb, his mother, his sisters? Or was their howling something else as Maester Luwin and Old Nan seemed to think? When Maester Luwin comes to Bran, he asks the maester if trees dream. Luwin says no, but Bran tells him they do, that he dreams sometimes of a weirwood tree, and it calls to him. He also tells the maester about the wolf dreams. When Luwin returns with a potion to help Bran sleep dreamless, Osha asks him if it is the wolf dreams again. She tells him, "You should not fight so hard. Might be the gods are trying to talk back." Yet that night, Bran has a wolf dream again, and through Summer's eyes Bran realizes the world was calling, and he knew he must answer or die.</p>

<h2>Arya (II) {VII}   pg 61/81</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Jaqen H'ghar (Lorathi prisoner from the black cells of King's Landing, then bound for the Wall, possibly an assassin of the Faceless Men);</p>
<p>Rorge (criminal from the black cells bound for the Wall, missing his nose, later in service to Lord Vargo Hoat);</p>
<p>Biter (criminal from the black cells, a mute with sharpened teeth, later in with Rorge);</p>
<p>Praed*, Reysen* (recruits bound for the Wall);</p>
<p>Cutjack, Tarber (recruits bound for the Wall, later run off on their own);</p>
<p>Dobber*, Kurz* and Koss* (criminals bound for the Wall).</p>
<p>Yoren and his recruits continue north nearing the God's Eye. They stop at an inn, and Arya learns that the wolves in the area have grown bolder, and there is a great pack of hundreds of wolves led by a she-wolf. Arya thinks of Nymeria, and wonders if her direwolf hates her. Arya leaves the inn and is accosted by the 3 criminals chained in the wagon. The Lorathi, who names himself Jaqen H'ghar, asks her to get him more ale. She notices that the way he talks is similar to Syrio. The other two also start banging for more ale. Biter then lunges at her, but she hits him in the face with her wooden sword. Gendry tells her later that Yoren warned them not to go near those three, but Arya is not afraid. Arya challenges him to a fight, but they are interrupted by Gold Cloaks arriving at the inn, and Arya pulls Gendry down behind a hedge. </p>
<p>The officer says he has a warrant from the Queen for a certain boy, but Yoren tells him to be gone, that these men are all bound for the Wall. When the officer draws his sword, Yoren warns him he has 30 men to the gold cloaks five. The recruits then begin to pick up weapons, but Arya doesn't want anyone dying for her. She reveals herself saying she's the one they want, but the officer points behind her at Gendry, stating he's the one they want. Yoren then puts his sword at the throat of the officer and tells them to leave. The gold cloaks depart, but the officer tells Yoren to hurry to the Wall, or they'll have his head to go with the bastard boy's. Arya doesn't understand why the Queen wants Gendry, and neither does he. Yoren tells them that from now on if they encounter gold cloaks, the two of them are to ride with all haste to the Wall..</p>

<h2>Jon (I) {X}   pg 70/93</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Endrew Tarth* (new master-at-arms of Castle Black);</p>
<p>Conwy (a wandering crow of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Thoren Smallwood* (senior ranger of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>Legends: King Daeron II Targaryen (King Daeron the Good, Targaryen Dragonking who brought Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms by marrying the Dornish Princess Myriah; son of Queen Naerys and either King Aegon IV or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, father of Baelor Breakspear, Aerys I, Rhaegel and Maekar, grandfather of Maester Aemon and Aegon V [Egg], did not receive the ancient Targaryen blade 'Blackfyre' as Aegon IV gave it to his highborn bastard Daemon Blackfyre instead);</p>
<p>Maekar Targaryen (Prince of Summerhall, later King Maekar I, fourth son of King Daeron II, father of Daeron, Aerion Brightflame, Maester Aemon and Egg; referred to as the 'Anvil' during the Blackfyre Rebellion as many believe that it was Maekar and Baelor's flanking of Daemon Blackfyre's army as the 'Hammer and the Anvil' that won the battle of the Redgrass Field);</p>
<p>King Aerys I Targaryen (second son of King Daeron II, succeeded his father as King, older brother of Maekar; named one of his grandfather's bastards as his Hand, the highborn bastard of Aegon IV, Lord Bloodraven);</p>
<p>Prince Daeron Targaryen (Daeron the Drunken, eldest son of Maekar, died from a pox);</p>
<p>Prince Aerion Brightflame (the Monstrous, Aerion Brightfire, second son of Maekar, died drinking wildfire);</p>
<p>Aegon (called Egg, later King Aegon V Targaryen, Aegon the Unlikely, Aegon the Fortunate, fourth son of Maekar, former squire of the hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall, younger brother of Maester Aemon);</p>
<p>King Aegon IV Targaryen (Aegon the Unworthy, son of King Viserys II, brother of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, husband of Queen Naerys and possible father of King Daeron II; legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed, including his 4 'Great Bastards': Prince Daemon Blackfyre, Aegor Rivers [Bittersteel], Brynden Rivers [Lord Bloodraven], and Lady Shiera Seastar; gave the hereditary Targaryen sword 'Blackfyre' to his bastard son Daemon instead of his trueborn son Daeron the Good).</p>
<p>Jon finds Sam in the basement library of the Night's Watch, a treasure trove with thousands of ancient books and accounts. Sam shows Jon the accounts of a ranger from before the conquest, who wrote that they had fought Giants beyond the Wall, and even traded with the children of the forest. Sam also found a book about the language of the children and other works that even the Citadel doesn't have. Sam is afraid to accompany the men on their mission, but Jon reassures him that Mormont is taking 200 men, and they will be met by 100 more from the Shadow Tower under the command of Qhorin Halfhand. They depart to bring the maps to the Lord Commander. Jon meets Donal Noye on the way, but Jon had already heard that Robb was now a King. Donal Noye reveals that he had forged King Robert's warhammer. </p>
<p>In the Lord Commander's chambers, Thoren Smallwood is demanding that he should have the command on the march, and that Mormont should stay at Castle Black. Mormont dismisses him, telling him he is not First Ranger until Ben Stark is found for dead, and then it will be the Lord Commander's decision of who replaces him. Sam gives Mormont the maps, and tells him Maester Aemon is choosing the ravens that will go with them. Mormont tells Jon of Maester Aemon, how he was the third son of Maekar who was the fourth son of King Daeron II. King Daeron, Maester Aemon's grandfather, sent him to the Citadel when he was a boy. The Crown Prince, Baelor, died in a tourney mishap <see The Hedge Knight summary>, and his two sons died from the Great Spring Sickness along with King Daeron, so the King's second son Aerys succeeded him. After King Aerys I died without issue, the crown passed to Maekar. King Maekar was killed in battle against an outlaw lord, and his two eldest sons, Daeron and Aerion, were already dead. A Great Council was convened to decide on the succession, and passed over Aerion's infant son, and then offered the throne to Aemon. The Maester refused, saying he swore a vow to serve even though the High Septon offered to absolve him. Aegon was then named King, called the Unlikely because he was the fourth son of a fourth son. Maester Aemon came to the Wall in order to protect his brother. Mormont explains to Jon why he spoke of this, because both Jon and Maester Aemon have something in common, a king for a brother. Jon swears he will not attempt to join Robb, that he will be troubled but keep his vows.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (I) {XII}   pg 81/107 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Robin Ryger (Captain of the guard at Riverrun);</p>
<p>Ser Cleos Frey* (eldest son of Ser Emmon Frey and Genna Lannister, cousin to Tyrion, Jaime and Cersei).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Stafford Lannister* (cousin of Lord Tywin, brother to the late Lady Joanna; slain at Oxcross by Lord Rickard Karstark).</p>
<p>Legends: King Harren the Black (King of the Iron Islands and the Riverlands, built Harrenhal as his castle taking 40 years and finally moving in the day Aegon the Conqueror landed; slain along with his family by dragonfire as Aegon's dragons burned his host within the walls of Harrenhal; grandson of King Harwyn Hardhand who had taken the Riverlands from Arrec the Storm King, their line descended from King Qhored when the ironmen had intermarried with the Andal invaders).</p>
<p>Robb is wearing his newly forged crown, and has Ser Cleos Frey brought before him. He tells Ser Cleos that he intends to send him as messenger to King's Landing with a peace offer. Robb tells him that he will not be granted freedom because he chose to fight for the Lannisters, even though his grandfather pledged Robb his support. As Robb begins to list the conditions of the peace offer, Lord Rickard Karstark silently leaves the room. Robb's proposal is obviously going to be rejected, as it is too harsh, all in the favor of the Starks. Afterwards, Ser Edmure tells Robb that they should be marching on Harrenhal, not offering peace. Robb tells him they lack the strength. Catelyn had told Robb that he should have offered sweeter terms, but it was all she could do just to convince him to make this offer. Robb tells his mother she should return to Winterfell, that she could travel with Theon to Seagard and then take ship home. Catelyn warns Robb not to send Theon as envoy to treat with his father, that Balon Greyjoy would be more likely to yield his longships to Robb if they kept Theon as hostage. She warns him that Balon Greyjoy is not a man to be trusted, and he may aspire to wear a crown again. </p>
<p>Robb then dismisses his mother and is final about sending Theon. Cat meets her uncle Brynden at her father's bedside, and learns that he has made peace with his brother. Cat tells him that the Greatjon says the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned, and Edmure believes the comet is an omen of victory for Riverrun, but she is not convinced. The Blackfish tells her it represents blood, and when Cat asks whose blood, theirs' or their enemies', her uncle says, "Was there ever a war where only one side bled?" Ser Brynden has dire tidings of the war, and reveals that the river lords are losing. He tells her that Ser Gregor crushed the Darry castle and killed the lord who was only a child and the last of the Darry line. Ser Brynden warns that Lord Tywin seeks to provoke them to battle, by butchering innocents and eating their harvest while he waits secure in Harrenhal. He reveals that Ser Stafford Lannister is raising another army at Casterly Rock. Cat suggests that if Lord Tywin had to leave Harrenhal to face another threat, they could meet him on fair ground. Her uncle picks up her meaning, that someone should go to treat with King Renly.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (II) {XI}   pg 93/122</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Jacelyn Bywater* (called Ironhand, former captain of the River Gate, later Lord Commander of the City Watch, later Lord Jacelyn Bywater).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Allar Deem* (Lord Janos Slynt's sergeant, sent to the Wall, presumed dead).
</p>
<p>            Tyrion is having Lord Janos Slynt for a guest, and getting him drunk. Tyrion asks him who should succeed him when he leaves the City Watch to take up residence at Harrenhal, and Slynt suggests Allar Deem. Tyrion mentions Ser Jacelyn Bywater, knighted at Pyke after losing his hand in the battle, but Slynt says he is too rigid and too honorable! Tyrion learns that Slynt sent Allar Deem to kill a young whore and her infant daughter Barra, a bastard of King Robert. Tyrion asks him who ordered him to kill the whore's bastard, but Slynt will not reveal the answer, priding himself on doing a deed with never a question asked. Tyrion suggests the Night's Watch could use men like him and Allar Deem. When Tyrion questions him about Lord Eddard's death, Slynt says even Varys was surprised by the King's decision, and we learn Varys had helped persuade Cersei to allow Ned to take the black. Slynt calls Lord Stark a traitor for trying to buy him, to which Tyrion says, "Little dreaming that you had already been bought." Slynt gets angry at this, telling Tyrion he has no right to question his honor. Tyrion then threatens him by saying that he should thank the gods it was Tyrion he had to deal with, and not his lord father. Tyrion tells him his children will inherit lands and his eldest son be named Lord Slynt when he comes of age, but Janos is bound for the Wall. Slynt is enraged, and tells Tyrion he will speak to the King about this, but Ser Jacelyn Bywater takes Slynt into custody.</p>
<p>Tyrion tells Bywater that Slynt and six others will board ship for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, and that it would not be taken amiss if Allar Deem should get swept overboard. Varys meets Tyrion afterward, and Tyrion accuses the eunuch of not telling him that it was his sister who sent the gold cloaks after the whore's bastard. Tyrion is upset that he hands out justice for the sorry likes of Slynt and Deem while his sister continues on her savage course. Tyrion knows he cannot touch his sister, yet. Varys tells Tyrion he could not save the baby girl, but he had taken steps to save another bastard, this one an older boy (Gendry). Tyrion again talks with Varys about Eddard's death, aware that Slynt and Ser Ilyn had carried out the King's sentence without hesitation, almost as if they expected it. Varys then asks Tyrion about the answer to his riddle, and Tyrion says the sellsword holds the true power. Varys asks "if it is the swordsmen who rule in truth, why pretend kings hold the power?" That day at Baelor's Sept, neither the godly High Septon nor the lawful Queen Regent nor the ever-knowledgeable Varys could prevent Lord Eddard's death. He asks who truly killed Eddard: the King who gave the command, Ser Ilyn who swung the sword, or another? Varys departs after telling Tyrion about prophets in the streets foretelling doom and causing problems. When Bronn comes, Tyrion tells him he probably replaced one of Littlefinger's men with one belonging to Varys when he made Ser Jacelyn the Commander of the City Watch. He asks Bronn if he would kill an infant girl without question if he were commanded to. Bronn replies, "Without question? No. I'd ask how much."</p>

<h2>Arya (III) {VIII}   pg 104/136</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Murch* (recruit bound for the Wall).</p>
<p>Gendry is telling the others that he knows nothing about why the Queen wants him. All he knows is that one day Master Mott came to him and told him he was to join the Night's Watch. Yoren has decided to avoid the Kingsroad and they travel along the western shore of the God's Eye. They then come upon a holdfast that was burning the night before. They find a little girl and her badly injured mother as the only survivors. Later at night, Arya goes off to make water where no one will notice, and she is surprised by a wolf. The wolf stares at her, but then bounds off into the woods. She goes to tell Yoren of the wolves in the forest, and the old man tells her he has been bringing men to the Wall for 30 years, always by the Kingsroad, but he should have taken ship this time.</p>

<h2>Davos (I)   pg 111/145</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Allard* (second son of Ser Davos, captain of the Lady Marya);</p>
<p>Dale* (eldest son of Ser Davos, captain of the Wraith);</p>
<p>Septon Barre (priest of the Seven at Dragonstone, later imprisoned);</p>
<p>Ser Hubard Rambton* (knight sworn to Dragonstone);</p>
<p>Devan (fifth son of Ser Davos, squire of King Stannis).</p>
<p>Legends: Azor Ahai (legendary hero of the god R'hllor; forged Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes);</p>
<p>Nissa Nissa (Azor Ahai's wife who died in the forging of Lightbringer).</p>
<p>Melisandre and the Queen's men are burning the statues of the seven gods in the sept at Dragonstone as a sacrifice to R'hllor. Those who tried to stop this blasphemy were either killed, like Ser Rambton, or imprisoned, like Lord Sunglass and Septon Barre. Davos remains steady during this event, because he believes he owes everything to Stannis, and is forever loyal. Melisandre has Stannis draw a near-molten sword from the conflagration, naming the sword Lightbringer and Stannis Azor Ahai come again. The sword is a burning mess, and Stannis has to drop it. Later, Davos meets Salladhor Saan at a tavern, and the Lyseni pirate tells him that the red priests in Lys are always burning things in the name of R'hllor. He also tells Davos the legend of the forging of Lightbringer, how Azor Ahai had to keep reforging the sword hundreds of times, until he finally plunged it in his wife's heart, and it was her courage and blood that created the sword. Saan tells Davos to be thankful the sword Stannis raised was not real, for "too much light can hurt the eyes, and fire burns." Davos then visits Stannis, who has composed a letter he intends to distribute throughout the realm. It proclaims Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen bastards born of incest, and names Stannis the rightful heir to Robert's throne. Davos and his sons are to carry the letters to the coastal towns, but the Onion Knight tells Stannis to remove the part about 'the Lord of Light' in the letter. Stannis rebuffs him, saying he appeases the Red Woman because she has power.</p>

<h2>Theon (I)   pg 125/164</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Aeron Greyjoy (called Damphair, a priest of the Drowned God, uncle of Theon and Asha, youngest brother of Lord Balon; his ship sunk during the Rebellion, but he washed up on the shores of Lannisport, where he was imprisoned at Casterly Rock; after his drowning, he returned a fanatical priest);</p>
<p>Helya (keeper of the castle at Pyke);</p>
<p>Lord Balon Greyjoy* (Lord of the Iron Islands, Lord Reaper of Pyke, 10 years prior proclaimed himself King of the Iron Islands but his rebellion was overthrown by King Robert, later again proclaimed himself King of the Iron Islands, father of Theon and Asha, elder brother of Euron Crow's Eye, Victarion and Aeron Damphair).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Rodrik Greyjoy* (eldest son of Lord Balon, slain by Lord Jason Mallister during the raid of Seagard);</p>
<p>Maron Greyjoy* (second son of Lord Balon, slain at Pyke during Greyjoy's Rebellion).</p>
<p>Legends: King Urron Redhand (legendary High King of the Iron Islands who made the throne hereditary by killing all the other kings of salt and rock, his line extinguished a thousand years later by the Andal invaders, and thereafter the ironmen intermarried with the Andals).</p>
<p>Theon is nearing Lordsport on the ship Myraham, and considers the Old Way, when the ironmen lived by the axe and took what they wanted. That ended with the coming of Aegon the Dragon, who gave the Riverlands to the Tullys and banished the ironmen back to the Iron Islands. Theon reminisces of how his father had raised his banners in rebellion more to bring back the Old Way, than for the empty vanity of a crown. The captain's daughter on the ship pleads with Theon to take her as his salt wife, but he ignores her and walks off the ship into Lordsport. None of the people seem to recognize who he is, and there is no escort from his father save his uncle Aeron Damphair, now a sour priest of the Drowned God. Theon remembers how his uncle had always been jovial, but the man was now a devout after his near drowning a few years back. Damphair tells Theon that he is a boy of the green lands now, and is hardly welcome on Pyke. </p>
<p>Even Theon's validity as heir to Pyke is put to the question by his uncle, who reminds Theon of his older sister Asha. Theon hated Lord Eddard, and had only gotten along with Robb, considering himself more a hostage than a ward during the 10 years he spent at Winterfell. He is still confident of the letter he carried from Robb, with a plan Theon had devised himself. At Pyke, Theon is ushered into a long-disused room in the Bloody Tower where a thousand years before the sons of the River King had been slaughtered. When he is finally called in to see Lord Balon, his father mocks the way he dresses, and the fact the gold chain he wears was not bought by paying the iron price. Theon had forgotten much of the Old Way, and his father is merciless in his derision. When Theon presents his father with the letter from Robb, Lord Balon burns it, yelling at Theon not to name the Stark boy as a brother in his hearing. Lord Balon says the boy offers him a crown, but the Lord Reaper intends to take his own crown, and not by invading Lannisport as had been Theon's plan, but a location far riper.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (I) {XI}   pg 142/187</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal (Dany's three young dragons);</p>
<p>Xaro Xhoan Daxos (Merchant Prince of the Thirteen from Qarth);</p>
<p>Pyat Pree (warlock from Qarth);</p>
<p>Quaithe (a masked shadowbinder from Asshai by the Shadow).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lynesse (Ser Jorah's second wife, youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower, great-niece of Ser Gerold Hightower, now concubine to a merchant prince from Lys);</p>
<p>Lord Leyton Hightower (the Voice of Oldtown, Lord of the Port, Lord of the High Tower, Defender of the Citadel, Beacon of the South; bannerman to the Tyrells; sometimes called the Old Man of Oldtown).</p>
<p>Dany believes the gods have sent the comet to show her the way. Yet as her small khalasar crosses the red lands following the trail of the comet, many die in the harsh climate including Dany's handmaiden Doreah. When her dragons are not eating the meat she feeds them, Dany remembers something Viserys had told her, that only men and dragons eat cooked meat. From then on, she feeds them cooked meat, and the dragons begin to grow. Dany recalls that Aegon's dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria, but she chooses new names for hers. Finally, they reach an ancient, deserted city that they name Vaes Tolorro, the city of bones. Dany learns the true story of Jorah's fall, how he had been knighted by King Robert on Pyke, and shortly thereafter won a tourney at Lannisport where he had met Lynesse, his second wife. But Bear Island was a lonely place for a girl from Oldtown, and so Jorah had to spend lavishly on her to keep her happy. Eventually, the Lord of Bear Island was near penniless, and sold some poachers to a slaver rather than making them take the black, and Lord Eddard came to behead him. Ser Jorah fled to Braavos with Lynesse, but she left him for a merchant prince in Lys. Dany then discovers that Ser Jorah loves her as more than a queen, because he says she resembles Lynesse. Later, Dany sends her bloodriders out in different directions to find civilization, but only Jhogo, who went southeast following the comet, found a city. And he brought back with him the three seekers from the great city of Qarth, who came to see dragons.</p>

<h2>Jon (II) {XI}   pg 154/203</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Eddison Tollett (Dolorous Edd, steward and squire of the Night's Watch and eventually steward to Lord Commander Jon Snow);</p>
<p>Jarmen Buckwell (senior ranger of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Ser Mallador Locke* (senior ranger);</p>
<p>Bedwyck (called Giant, a fareyes of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>The Night's Watch discovers the wildling village Whitetree deserted, as have all the other villages they've been through. The heart tree in the village is the largest Jon's ever seen, and there are burnt bones in its mouth. The Night's Watch has long known that the wildlings burn their dead, but only recently have they learned why. Jon goes to see Sam after they search the village, and tells him that Mormont wants a raven sent to Maester Aemon with their progress so far. Mormont tells Jon that if Benjen had found all these villages empty, he would have tried to learn why, and someone or something might not have wanted him to find out.</p>

<h2>Arya (IV) {IX}   pg 160/211</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Woth*, Qyle*, Gerren*, Urreg* (recruits bound for the Wall);</p>
<p>Ser Amory Lorch* (knight sworn to Casterly Rock, commander of Lord Tywin's foragers).</p>
<p>Yoren's band has come upon a burned-out holdfast, and explores it for boats, finding nothing. Yoren decides to camp secure behind the walls for the night. That night, Arya awakens to a wolf howling, and then wakes the others in warning. Outside the walls, Ser Amory Lorch's men are demanding that the gates be opened in the name of the King. He accuses them of being in league with Lord Beric Dondarrion, and do not believe Yoren when he tells them they are members of the Night's Watch and take no part in any wars. Ser Amory has his men fire the houses and then begin scaling the walls. Many from both sides die, and when all seems lost, Yoren tells Arya to escape through a hidden tunnel in the barn. Arya takes the little girl (whose mother died) with her and follows Hot Pie, Gendry and the injured Lommy into the tunnel. At the last minute, as the fires rage in the barn, Arya decides to save the 3 criminals chained in the wagon by throwing Rorge an axe. Arya then flees through the tunnel.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (III) {XII}   pg 172/228      </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ironbelly (a blacksmith);</p>
<p>Salloreon* (a master armorer, later imprisoned for treason);</p>
<p>Alayaya (a whore, daughter of Chataya).</p>
<p>The Queen is furious after learning that Stannis is circulating letters accusing her of incest. Despite her guilt, she does not want this reaching her son or her father, but there may be nothing to stop that. Tyrion advises they let people talk, but without proof no one will believe it; Littlefinger goes further by suggesting they circulate their own vile rumors, that Shireen is really the daughter of the ugly Queen Selyse and the lackwit fool Patchface. While the other counselors wonder where Varys is, Tyrion takes his leave. He meets with many of the city's smiths in his great hall, and asks them to stop forging armor and begin forging a giant chain. Several armorers complain, but Tyrion warns them that they will either forge a chain or wear one, the choice is theirs. </p>
<p>Tyrion then departs for Chataya's brothel, and there learns that in the Summer Isles, being a whore is considered an honor. Tyrion follows Alayaya upstairs, and she shows him a secret staircase in the back of her wardrobe. Tyrion follows it down a tunnel and meets Varys, who is in disguise. Tyrion will take a horse to the mansion where he is keeping Shae safe, but first he and Varys talk. Varys makes it known that some of the Queen's spies are really his spies. Tyrion asks Varys how Stannis learned of the Queen's incest and the Spider tells him that perhaps he read a book or looked at bastards' hair, as Lord Eddard and Jon Arryn had; or perhaps someone whispered it to him. Tyrion asks Varys if it was he, but Varys denies it, and when Tyrion names Littlefinger the eunuch tells him, "I named no name." When Tyrion tells him he sometimes considers him his best friend, but at other times his worst enemy, Varys tells him he feels much the same way about him.</p>

<h2>Bran (II) {IX}   pg 183/243</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Wyman Manderly (Lord of White Harbor, bannerman to the Starks, father of Ser Wylis and Ser Wendel);</p>
<p>Lady Donella Hornwood* (widow of Lord Harys Hornwood, later forced to marry the Bastard of Bolton);</p>
<p>Mors Umber (called Mors Crowfood, uncle to the Greatjon);</p>
<p>Hother Umber (called Hother Whoresbane, uncle to the Greatjon);</p>
<p>Leobald Tallhart* (castellan of Torrhen's Square, younger brother of Ser Helman Tallhart);</p>
<p>Cley Cerwyn* (son of Lord Medger Cerwyn, later Lord).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Larence Snow (bastard son of the late Lord Hornwood, a ward of Galbart Glover at Deepwood Motte);</p>
<p>Beren Tallhart (son of Leobald Tallhart and Berena Hornwood [sister of the late Lord Hornwood], nephew through marriage of Lady Hornwood);</p>
<p>Reek* (servant of the Bastard of Bolton, real name is Heke);</p>
<p>Domeric* (only trueborn son of Lord Roose Bolton).</p>
<p>Bran is being carried by Hodor to host Lord Wyman Manderly, and on the way the two Walders begin to mock Hodor. Bran defends him until Maester Luwin appears and reprimands the boys. Bran meets the obese Lord Wyman, and they discuss White Harbor minting coins for the North, building a fleet of ships, and the Lord even inquires about a marriage to the widowed Lady Hornwood. He wants to know if an exchange of hostages can be arranged so that his son Ser Wylis will be released by Lord Tywin. After him, Bran hosts Lady Hornwood, whose husband had died at the Green Fork and son at the Whispering Wood. Lady Hornwood warns that Roose Bolton's bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort and he seems intent on her lands. Lord Bolton had never acknowledged the boy, yet he used the name Bolton and it was whispered that he and his servant Reek hunted more than just deer. </p>
<p>It is obvious that the widow will need to remarry to hold her lands, but to who is the question. Luwin notes that the Lady likes Ser Rodrik. Bran suggests that Lord Hornwood's bastard, a ward of Galbart Glover, be named as heir. The uncles of the Greatjon come next, and Ser Rodrik tells them they are to begin lumbering wood for Lord Wyman's shipwrights. When Leobald Tallhart feasts with Bran, he suggests his younger son Beren could take the name Hornwood, as his mother was sister to Lord Hornwood, and become heir. Maester Luwin believes he may be their best choice. Later, Cley Cerwin arrives, and when he mentions Cersei's incest, Bran begins to have a flashback and feels like he's falling, and that night dreams of the crow pecking at his forehead and telling him to fly, and then he sees a man with golden hair pushing him from a window.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (IV) {XIII}   pg 197/261 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hallyne the Pyromancer (Wisdom of the Guild of Alchemists, later titled lord);</p>
<p>Ser Tallad (called Ser Tallad the Tall, a hedge knight sworn to King Joffrey).</p>
<p>            Tyrion is having breakfast with Grand Maester Pycelle, and hands him two sealed letters to have sent by raven for Prince Doran Martell's eyes only. When Pycelle goes up to the rookery, Tyrion looks at Pycelle's potions, and steals one. Tyrion knows the Grand Maester is ultra curious, and lures him with the importance of the letters, but will not reveal what they contain. As Tyrion takes his leave, he smiles to himself one. Outside, Bronn is selecting recruits and sellswords, and points out a hedge knight named Tallad as the best of the lot. Bronn informs Tyrion of mobs gathering in the streets, and a black brother named Ser Alliser is demanding an audience, and he carries a dismembered hand in a jar. Tyrion tells him he will see Ser Alliser on the morrow. 
	Littlefinger visits later, and when Tyrion points out the dagger, Petyr offers it to him. Littlefinger knows his lie caused Tyrion anguish, and doesn't care. Tyrion knows Littlefinger's rise started as a tax collector appointed by Jon Arryn, but he eventually rose to master of coin, and replaced most of his predecessor's men with men of his own choosing. Tyrion knew that Littlefinger was too secure in his post, and realized he probably couldn't touch the man, even if Littlefinger was a traitor. Tyrion then sets Littlefinger up by offering him lordship of Harrenhal if he brings a message to Lady Lysa Arryn, whom Petyr has boasted of taking her maidenhead. Tyrion tells him he will offer her Lord Arryn's true murderer (to which Littlefinger is quite curious to know who), and his niece Myrcella as a ward to be betrothed to Lord Robert. Littlefinger is too greedy to pass up such a great position as Lord of Harrenhal and agrees to deliver the message. Tyrion thinks two.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Varys arrives and is aware of Tyrion's proposal to Littlefinger. He then puzzles out most of Tyrion's offer to Prince Doran Martell: a seat on the council, Tyrion's nephew Tommen as ward, and the head of Ser Gregor Clegane who murdered his sister. When Varys asks what Lord Tywin would think, Tyrion replies, "My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog." Varys cautions Tyrion that his sister will never consent to sending away both Tommen and Myrcella, and Tyrion tells him that if his sister were to find out his plans, he would know Varys told her. He thinks to himself three.</p>

<h2>Sansa (II) {VIII}   pg 211/279</h2>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Tytos Lannister* (former Lord of Casterly Rock, father of Lord Tywin, Ser Kevan, Ser Tygett, Genna and Gerion).</p>
<p>Legends: Florian the Fool (legendary fool who was the greatest knight of all, champion of Jonquil);</p>
<p>Jonquil (legendary lady love of Florian).</p>
<p>Sansa had found a note under her pillow telling her to come to the godswood that night if she wanted to go home. Mistrustful of who left it, Sansa eventually decides to go when she hears a commotion at the gate to the Red Keep. She slips unseen to the godswood, and there meets Ser Dontos. Hoping it would be a true knight come to rescue her, she is disappointed by the appearance of the old drunk fool. He deftly makes Sansa think of the legend of Florian and Jonquil, her favorite story. Now trusting Dontos, he promises to rescue her from the city when the time is right. After leaving the godswood, she runs into the Hound, who is drunk. Clegane tells her she looks like a woman, and asks her to sing to him, but then forgets he asked. He escorts her back to her room, and finds out from Ser Boros that a mob came to the gates seeking food from Tyrek's wedding feast. Sansa asks him why he lets people call him 'dog', and he tells her of how his grandfather was kennelmaster at Casterly Rock and saved Lord Tytos Lannister's life. Lord Tytos raised the Cleganes to lords from then on, and thus his brother Ser Gregor was a lord. The Hound leaves by telling her he will hear a song from her eventually.</p>

<h2>Arya (V) {X}   pg 219/289</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Weasel (a girl found by Yoren's band, later runs off and is never seen again).</p>
<p>Arya and Gendry had returned to the holdfast and found Yoren dead, and met up with a few recruits who were still in the tower. They are living off the land, near starving as they head north along the east shore of the God's Eye. After Kurz dies from an infection, Tarber and Cutjack run off, leaving Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie and the now orphaned girl Weasel to carry the injured Lommy. When they spy a village up ahead, Hot Pie and Lommy suggest they yield, but Arya and Gendry go off to investigate. Alone, Gendry tells Arya that he knows she is a girl, and Arya cannot trick him any further, revealing herself as Arya Stark. Gendry then gets captured, and Arya goes back to get help. Hot Pie goes with her, but he yields immediately, and they both get caught. The camp they get locked in has several dead bodies hung outside, and is the camp of Ser Gregor Clegane. The Mountain's men force her to reveal their hiding place, and when they get there Weasel is gone, but Lommy is killed because none of the men intend to carry him.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (V) {XIV}   pg 232/307</h2>
<p>Tyrion is visiting the Guildhall of the Alchemists, and learns that the Wisdoms have over 7000 vials of wildfire, 4000 of them from King Aerys' day. The Mad King used the Pyromancers frequently to torture people. Hallyne promises 10000 will be ready when Tyrion needs them. After he leaves, Bronn reports that Ser Jacelyn has his cousin Ser Cleos at the Gate of the Gods. Ser Cleos delivers Robb's peace terms, and when Tyrion returns to his Tower, Cersei is waiting, and confronts him about offering Myrcella to Prince Doran Martell. Tyrion now knows that Pycelle is the Queen's creature. Tyrion tells her that the Dornishmen have been fighting against Storm's End and Highgarden for a thousand years, yet Renly has assumed Prince Doran's allegiance. He feels that Dorne would help them if Prince Doran were given some indication that he could trust them. Myrcella as ward, and the head of his sister's murderer might make Prince Doran concede. When Cersei tries to slap Tyrion again, he stops her hand, warning her not to strike him again. Cersei breaks down crying, revealing something Tyrion has known for a long time about his sister: that she wishes she were born a man and could wield a sword. Tyrion then shows her Robb's peace terms, and he realizes that she will now consent to the Dornish marriage.
</p>

<h2>Bran (III) {X}   pg 244/323</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Poxy Tym*, Skittrick*, Alebelly* (guardsmen at Winterfell);</p>
<p>Meera Reed (daughter of Lord Howland Reed, older sister of Jojen);</p>
<p>Jojen Reed (son of Howland Reed, younger brother of Meera, possesses the greensight).
</p>
<p>Bran is hosting the remaining lords in the North for the harvest feast, when Meera and Jojen Reed arrive. Bran knows them as Crannogmen, from the Neck, and the children of his father's bannerman Howland Reed. Many mock the crannogmen as frog eaters and thieves, but Maester Luwin tells Bran that Howland Reed was a great friend of his father. Meera and Jojen were sent by their father to renew their oaths, for Lord Howland has not set foot from Greywater Watch in over 15 years, since the war ended. Jojen asks Bran where the direwolves were, knowing of them even though he had just arrived. The singers in the Great Hall sing of "The Night that Ended" where the Night's Watch rode forth to fight the Others in the Battle for the Dawn. That night, while Bran lies in bed, he remembers asking his father if the Kingsguard were the finest knights in the realm, and Lord Eddard had replies, "No longer. But once they were a marvel, a shining example to the world." Bran asked who the best of them was, and Ned replied, "The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who would have killed me but for Howland Reed." His father had gotten sad then and would not speak any further. Later, Bran dreams through the eyes of Summer, and sees Meera and Jojen enter the godswood. When Jojen reaches out his hand to touch Summer, Bran loses contact and feels like he is falling again.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (II) {XIII}   pg 252/334 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Shadd (soldier in Robb's army);</p>
<p>Robin Flint* (battle companion of Robb, son of Lady Lyessa Flint);</p>
<p>Ser Colen of Greenpools (knight sworn to King Renly);</p>
<p>Ser Ronnet Connington (Red Ronnet, the knight of Griffin's Roost);</p>
<p>Lord Mathis Rowan (Lord of Goldentree, bannermen to the Tyrells);</p>
<p>Lord Randyll Tarly (Lord of Horn Hill, father of Samwell Tarly, bannerman of the Tyrells, possesses the Valyrian blade 'Heartsbane');</p>
<p>Lady Arwyn Oakheart (Lady of Old Oak, bannerlady to the Tyrells, mother of Ser Arys);</p>
<p>Margaery Tyrell (daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell, sister of Ser Loras, wife of King Renly, later betrothed to King Joffrey);</p>
<p>Brienne (of Tarth, called 'The Beauty' and the Maid of Tarth; once knight of King Renly's Rainbow Guard, the Blue; daughter of Lord Selwyn, later sworn shield of Lady Catelyn, later possesses the Valyrian sword 'Oathkeeper');</p>
<p>Lord Caswell (minor lord of Bitterbridge);</p>
<p>Lucas Blackwood* (battle companion of Robb, son of Lord Tytos Blackwood);</p>
<p>Ser Jon Fossoway (of the green apple Fossoways, knight sworn to the Tyrells);</p>
<p>Josua and Elyas (sons of Lord Willum);</p>
<p>Lord Steffon Varner (bannerman to the Tyrells, joins King Stannis after Renly's death);</p>
<p>Ser Guyard Morrigen* (member of King Renly's Rainbow Guard, the Green);</p>
<p>Ser Mark Mullendore (knight sworn to Highgarden, lost an arm in the Battle of the Blackwater);</p>
<p>Ser Tanton Fossoway (of the red apple Fossoways).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Selwyn Tarth (called the Evenstar, father of Brienne, bannerman to Storm's End, Lord of Evenfall Hall).
</p>
<p>            Catelyn and the men guarding her are nearing Renly's camp. She remembers Robb telling her she would be best suited to treat with the king, that an alliance could turn the war, especially since all his messages to his aunt Lysa have been ignored and the Eyrie will not stir. Cat is soon escorted to King Renly, and sees the might of his army, near a hundred thousand strong. They are holding a tourney, and Cat watches the folly until the victor is declared. The last two standing were Ser Loras and Brienne, with Brienne the victor. She asks to be made a member of the Rainbow Guard, and Renly grants her request. The crowd mocks her as "the Beauty", but in fact Brienne is quite ugly, and taller even than Renly, yet obviously a fierce warrior. Cat is disturbed that Renly is holding a tourney when he should be marching on King's Landing. Renly greets her with courtesy and is very cordial. Catelyn is invited to the feast after the tourney, and then walks alone with Renly at the King's behest. Renly inquires about Ser Barristan, and is dismayed to learn he is not with Robb. He relates how he offered 100 men to Ned during Robert's last hours, and how Ned turned him down. Renly reveals that Mace Tyrell has another 10,000 men at Highgarden, and that he expects the Dornishmen to join him. Renly tells her that he must have Robb's loyalty, and that Robb must bend the knee. As they converse, a rider comes to the gates with word that Storm's End is besieged by King Stannis.</p>

<h2>Jon (III) {XII}   pg 267/354</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Ottyn Wythers* (senior ranger of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Craster* (wildling who owns a small fort in the Haunted Forest, has many daughter-wives);</p>
<p>Lark the Sisterman* (steward of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Gilly (one of Craster's daughter-wives).</p>
<p>Legends: Raymun Redbeard (King-beyond-the-Wall who marched on the Wall during the time of Lord Eddard's great-grandfather);</p>
<p>The Horned Lord, the brother kings Gendel and Gorne (legendary wildling kings who attempted to invade the Seven Kingdoms);</p>
<p>Joramun (ancient wildling king who blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the Earth).
</p>
<p>            The Lord Commander's force reaches Craster's fort, the first populated wildling settlement since they set out. Mormont commands his men to leave Craster's wives alone, and then enters the wildling's hall with his senior men. It is rumored that Craster's mother lay with a ranger, and that is why the wildling is courteous to the Night's Watch. Craster claims he has not seen Benjen Stark in three years, but he remembers Ser Waymar Royce and his party. When the Old Bear mentions the wights that attacked him at Castle Black, Craster feigns ignorance, but one of his wives recognizes the truth in the tale by the look of horror on her face. Craster tells Mormont that he is a free man, and hence has not heeded Mance Rayder's call, although all the other wildling settlements have. To learn more, Mormont gives Craster a brand new axe and some good wine in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Mance's host. Craster recognizes Jon as a Stark, and learns he is Eddard's bastard.</p>
<p>Jon goes in search of Sam so that the fat boy can draw a map, and finds Ghost has taken a rabbit from one of Craster's wives. Jon apologizes to the girl, who he notices is pregnant. The girl runs off when Lark the Sisterman warns her that Ghost might eat her. Jon finds Sam and tells him to attend the Old Bear, and the next morning he is awoken by the girl he had met the day before. Sam had told her Jon's brother is a king, and pleads with Jon to take her and her unborn child to the king. She fears for the child's life, and Jon learns that if it's a boy, Craster will give it to the gods. When Jon asks what gods, Gilly elaborates 'the cold gods, the white shadows', and Jon knows that Craster lied about not being aware of the Others and wights. Craster has been giving them sheep now since the Others come more often. Jon tells her he can't help her and she runs off. Jon later confronts Sam, who tells him he thought they could help the girl when they returned from the north, but Jon tells him he was a fool. As they depart, Jon mentions to Mormont that Craster has no sons, but Mormont is aware that Craster offers them to the Others as a type of prayer. The rangers have known this for a long time, but the Watch has found Craster to be helpful over the years, and Mormont would not harm the wildling. Mormont reveals that Mance Rayder is gathering the wildlings in the Frostfangs, and that he plans to stop the man he once knew.</p>

<h2>Theon (II)   pg 284/377</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Asha Greyjoy (daughter of Lord Balon Greyjoy, older sister of Theon, later holds Deepwood Motte);</p>

<p>Wex Pyke (Theon's squire, a mute, bastard son of Lord Botley's half-brother);</p>
<p>Victarion Greyjoy (Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, brother of Lord Balon and Aeron Damphair, killed his own wife after he caught her in bed with his brother Euron).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Euron Greyjoy (called Crow's Eye or Euron Croweye, eldest of Lord Balon's younger brothers, a raider and outlaw who has not been seen in two years, later claims the Seastone Chair when his brother dies and wins it outright during Aeron's Kings Moot);</p>
<p>Sigrin (shipwright at Pyke).</p>
<p>Theon is admiring the new longship his father gave him, when he meets a beautiful ironborn woman calling herself Esgred, wife to Sigrin the shipwright. Theon is taken with her, and although she claims to be pregnant, they flirt extensively on the way back to Pyke. Theon fondles her, and she does the same to Theon, continuing to lead him on. She gets him to confess he probably doesn't believe in the Drowned God, and that he thinks of his uncles as fools. When she asks of his mother, and Theon tells her she is away at Harlaw and her health is poor, she tells him he should go visit her. When they arrive at Pyke, the servants reveal that Esgred is really his sister Asha, and Theon is greatly disturbed by what he did and said to her. Theon goes to his father's feast, but his sister is given the place of honor, and she mocks him mercilessly throughout the dinner. Afterwards, Lord Balon reveals his war plans, commanding Theon to raid the Stony Shore, Asha to take Deepwood Motte, and his brother Victarion to take Moat Cailin, sealing off the North from Robb's return. Theon is given the most meaningless task, and realizes that his command will be nominal with his uncle Damphair and Dagmer Cleftjaw to watch over him.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (VI) {XV}   pg 299/397</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Tyrek Lannister (only son of the late Ser Tygett Lannister, once squire to King Robert, mocked as 'Wet Nurse' due to his marriage to the infant Lady Ermesande).</p>
<p>Tyrion enters Cersei's chambers to tell her that Stannis has landed, but is besieging Storm's End and will soon battle his brother Renly. Cersei is overjoyed by the news, and even hugs Tyrion. Tyrion proposes a toast and slips some powder into her glass. The next day, the Queen is sick, and Tyrion is able to treat with Ser Cleos and take care of court business without her interference. As Tyrion presides as Hand in the courtroom, we learn for the first time that Tyrion's cousin Tyrek has wed the infant Lady Ermesande, and is being mocked as "Wet Nurse". Tyrion's terms put forth to his cousin Ser Cleos are as equally absurd as Robb's were, and Tyrion does not reveal to Ser Cleos that they do not have Arya captive, as the northeners seem to think. He does send Eddard's bones back to Catelyn and Robb however. Tyrion then commands Vylarr to accompany Ser Cleos to Riverrun as an honor guard, getting rid of one of his sister's men. As court is about to be adjourned, Ser Alliser comes forth, but the severed hand of Jafer Flowers has rotted away, and he is mocked. Still, Tyrion hears a ring of truth in Thorne's word of wights, and allows him the pick of the city dungeons.</p>
<p>Littlefinger then confronts Tyrion, pissed off he had been lied to about Myrcella being promised to Robert Arryn, when she is instead to be sent off to Prince Doran Martell. Littlefinger warns Tyrion, "Leave me out of your next deception", and Tyrion thinks to himself, only if you'll do the same for me. Varys then speaks to Tyrion, aware of the Hand's attempt to free his brother by sending 4 thieves with Ser Cleos' party.</p>
<p>At midnight that night, Tyrion invades Grand Maester Pycelle's solar with Timett and Shagga. They find a young serving girl in the Grand Maester's bed, and send her away. Pycelle pleads with Tyrion that he never deceived him, that he is a true servant. He tries to place the blame on Varys, and then Littlefinger, but Tyrion reveals his ruse was designed to expose one of them as a traitor, and it was Pycelle who told Cersei his plan to send Myrcella to Prince Doran. Tyrion has Shagga chop off Pycelle's beard, and threatens to unman him. Pycelle reveals it was he who advised King Aerys to open the gates for Lord Tywin's army, and how he had hoped Tywin would become king.</p>
<p>Tyrion then asks him how many he has betrayed: Aerys, Eddard Stark, himself, King Robert, Jon Arryn, Prince Rhaegar? Pycelle pleads with him that Robert was a wretched king, that Renly was plotting to bring Mace Tyrell's daughter to court and have Cersei supplanted as Queen. Tyrion asks what Lord Arryn had been plotting, and Pycelle answers that Jon Arryn knew of Cersei's incest, and that he planned to send his wife back to the Eyrie, his son to foster on Dragonstone, and that he meant to act on his knowledge. Under duress, Pycelle finally leaks that the Queen needed Jon Arryn dead, although she had not said as much because Varys is always listening. But Pycelle swears he did not administer the poison, that he had only prevented Maester Colemon from healing Lord Arryn. The Grand Maester believes Ser Hugh gave Jon Arryn the poison, and that Cersei and Varys can confirm that. When Tyrion tells Shagga to bring the maester to the black cells and imprison him, Pycelle pleads that all he's done has been for the Lannisters. Tyrion is concerned, because he had hoped to trust Pycelle, for Varys and Littlefinger were far less loyal and far, far more dangerous in their subtlety. He wonders whether his father's way would have been better: to mount all three of their heads above the gates, and have done with it.</p>

<h2>Arya (VI) {XI}   pg 311/413</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> The Tickler* (an interrogator under Ser Gregor Clegane);</p>
<p>Chiswyck* (one of Ser Gregor's men);</p>
<p>Polliver* (man-at-arms under Ser Gregor, possesses Arya's sword 'Needle' for a time);</p>
<p>Dunsen (soldier under Ser Gregor Clegane);</p>
<p>Rafford (called Raff the Sweetling, soldier under Ser Gregor);</p>
<p>Goodwife Amabel and Goodwife Harra* (servants at Harrenhal to Lord Tywin);</p>
<p>Weese* (understeward of the Wailing Tower at Harrenhal).</p>
<p>Arya is among several prisoners being led to Harrenhal to serve as slave labor. Ser Gregor's interrogator questions them all over and over if they knew of Lord Beric Dondarrion's whereabouts and intentions. Several are killed. Arya first begins to make her roll call of the names of those she wishes dead. When they reach Harrenhal, Hot Pie is fearful because the great castle is said to be haunted. Arya tells the goodwives her name is Weasel, but when they command her to work in the kitchens, she mouths off and gets slapped. They send her to work under Weese in the Wailing Tower.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (II) {XII}   pg 317/422 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Quhuru Mo (trader captain from the Summer Isles, captain of the Cinnamon Wind).</p>
<p>Dany's tiny khalasar is led into the great city of Qarth by the three seekers. Pyat Pree tells her to come to the House of the Undying to learn of truth from the Warlocks. But it is Xaro Xhoan Daxos who lavishes her with gifts, and gives her a wing of his great palace to reside in. What Dany wants is swords and ships, neither of which she will gain in this city of excess. Xaro warns her extensively of the lies and dust offered by the Warlocks, but Ser Jorah mistrusts all the Qartheen. All Quaithe offers her is cryptic words: to beware all in Qarth, for when they see her dragons they will lust, because dragons are fire incarnate, and fire is power. She sends Ser Jorah to the docks, and he returns with a trader captain from the Summer Isles, who brings word of Westeros. He tells them that King Robert is dead and that Joffrey rules, but Robert's brothers are gathering their strengths to contest the throne. Dany promises him a reward if he visits her when she finally sits on her father's throne. Ser Jorah warns her that Robert's death changes nothing, but Dany disagrees, because the Seven Kingdoms will be in disarray if there is civil war.</p>

<h2>Bran (IV) {XI}   pg 325/433</h2>
<p>Bran, Jojen and Meera are playing with the direwolves, and Bran shows them that Summer will never hurt him or anyone he likes. Bran asks them if he would be welcome at Greywater Watch, and they assure him that their lord father would have welcomed him then or now, and that leaving Winterfell would be good for him. We learn that the Bastard of Bolton has taken Lady Hornwood as his wife, and that Lord Manderly has taken her castle to protect, but Ser Rodrik has gone east to settle the uprising and see that justice is done. Jojen asks Bran to share his dreams with him, but Bran is hesitant. Jojen knows, however, of Bran's dreams because he has the greensight. In a green dream, he saw a winged wolf bound to earth with stone chains, and a crow trying to peck through the chains. When Bran asks him if the crow had three eyes, Jojen nods and tells him that a similar crow came to him when he nearly died from greywater fever, and ever since he has had the green dreams.</p>
<p>They tell Bran that the crow lies North, beyond the Wall, and that when Jojen had told their father of the dream, it was Howland Reed who sent them to Winterfell. Jojen tells Bran that he can fly, if he would ever just open his third eye. Bran doesn't want to talk about the dreams anymore, but Jojen presses, telling him he that he knows Bran has wolf dreams, and can see through Summer's eyes. Jojen was aware of Bran's presence in Summer that first night, and tells Bran that it is his fear of falling which prevents him from opening his eye. He asks if Bran dreams of falling every night, but as Bran becomes increasingly more agitated, Summer starts to growl and advance on Jojen. The boy tells Bran that it is his anger and fear which is causing Summer's reaction, that the two are tied in emotion by strong bonds. Bran calls to Summer, but the wolf does not heed the call, and suddenly Shaggydog emerges snarling as well. Meera is fearful and tells her brother to climb the weirwood, but Jojen is unperturbed, stating "today is not the day I die". Nevertheless, they climb the tree to escape the direwolves rage. Finally Hodor chases the wolves off.</p>
<p>Bran goes to visit Maester Luwin and asks about the greensight. Luwin explains that the greenseers of the children claimed the power, and it allowed them to see great distances through the eyes carved in the weirwoods, and that they could communicate with the beasts of the forest. Luwin warns him that Jojen has no such power, and it is just coincidence if some of his dreams come true. Luwin then shows Bran a link of Valyrian steel in his chain, a link only one maester in a hundred has, that signifies he has studied the Higher Mysteries, or magic for lack of a better word. Luwin reveals that he even tried his hand at spellcasting, but did not succeed. He tells Bran that magic is gone from the world, gone with ancient Valyria and the last dragons. Bran later tells this to Meera, but she insists that Maester Luwin is wrong. She leaves him with another of Jojen's dreams, that one day soon Maester Luwin will serve him a great feast, but the portion he gives to the Walders will be grey and dead, but they will like their meal better than he.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (VII) {XVI}   pg 333/444 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Dancy (a whore at Chataya's brothel);</p>
<p>Marei (another whore at Chataya's brothel, with silvery hair).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Tysha (young woman whom Tyrion and Ser Jaime rescued, later wed Tyrion, then exposed as a whore hired by Jaime for his brother's birthday, raped by Lannister guardsmen at the command of Lord Tywin <See Tyrion chapter VI summary from AGOT>, however Jaime later admits that Tysha was not a whore and that their father had forced him to lie to Tyrion).</p>
<p>Tyrion was up late at night reading, when Pod brings word that his cousin Ser Lancel is outside demanding to see him. Lancel commands Tyrion to release Pycelle in the name of the king. When he warns Tyrion, the dwarf tells him, "I'll hear no warnings from you, boy." Lancel corrects him that he is a knight, and starts to reach for his sword, but Tyrion calls him a wineskin warrior. He asks Lancel if he was knighted before or after Cersei started taking him into her bed. Lancel is shocked that Tyrion knows of this incest, and when Tyrion bluffs that he will inform Joffrey that Lancel killed his father so he could bed his mother, Lancel turns to water. Tyrion tells him that he will continue to serve his sister, but report all he sees and hears to him. Tyrion promises he will release Pycelle, and that Cersei can keep him as a pet or send him to the wall, but he is stripped of his position on the council and as Grand Maester. Tyrion warns Lancel that he wants no more nephews and to watch where his seed falls. Tyrion feels a little remorse for the way he and Cersei are using Lancel, and that his weakness will lead to his death, either in the war or at the hands of Ser Jaime if he returned to King's Landing and found out. As Tyrion rides for Chataya's brothel, he reflects on the Lords Arryn and Stark, and how their nobility led to their downfall at his sister's hands, but Tyrion knew how to play her game and beat her. Later, with Shae, Tyrion feels like this is his place, holding all the power at court.</p>

<h2>Arya (VII) {XII}   pg 341/455</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Pia (servant girl at Harrenhal);</p>
<p>Vargo Hoat* (sellsword captain from Qohor in the service of Lord Tywin, called the Goat, lord of the Brave Companions [aka the Bloody Mummers], later joins the service of Lord Bolton and is granted Harrenhal).</p>
<p>Arya is thinking of what King Harren had meant to name the five towers of Harrenhal, but they were known as the Tower of Dread, the Widow's Tower, the Wailing Tower, the Tower of Ghosts, and Kingspyre Tower. Hot Pie was assigned to the kitchens, and Gendry to the forge, but Arya worked for the understeward running chores. Arya hates Weese and adds him to her list of names. She overhears a serving girl of Lord Tywin's maester talk of a letter that the Lord ordered burnt declaring that Joffrey was not King Robert's true son, and that Lord Tywin commanded that such filth should not be spread. Arya later sees the Bloody Mummers enter Harrenhal for the first time, and notes their odd dress and mounts, and their slobbering leader Vargo Hoat. Arya learns that Roose Bolton may attempt to cross the Ruby Ford of the Trident, and that her brother's army was nearby at Riverrun. She also knows of captives from Lord Bolton's host, but doesn't know any of them save Lord Cerwyn, who dies before Arya can speak to him. Two Freys came to ransom their three brothers and bastard brother, but no one came for the other captives. </p>
<p>Arya later hears that Lord Tywin sent Ser Gregor and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton's host. Eventually, Ser Amory Lorch arrives at Harrenhal, and amongst his men, Arya spots Rorge, Biter and Jaqen H'ghar. That night as Arya is asleep, Jaqen comes to her, and promises her three lives in exchange for the three the Red God lost when Arya saved them from the fire. Jaqen tells her, "Say the names, and a man will do the rest." Arya is unsure if she can trust Jaqen, but one night she hears one of Ser Gregor's men, Chiswyck, tell the others a horrifying tale of gang rape of a young tavern girl at the hands of Ser Gregor and his men, and they all laugh at the story. Arya then whispers Chiswyck's name to Jaqen the next night at dinner, and three days later Arya learns that Chiswyck fell from a tower and broke his neck, and some of the servants believe it was a ghost. But Arya knows she is the ghost in Harrenhal, and she scratches one name off her list.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (III) {XIV}   pg 352/470 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Eldon Estermont (ancient Lord of Greenstone, bannerman to the Baratheons, maternal grandfather of Robert, Stannis and Renly).</p>
<p>Legends: Durran Godsgrief (the first Storm King, wed Elenei bringing down the wrath of the gods; built numerous castles on Shipbreaker Bay, only to have them all destroyed by the winds and surf brought by the gods; built Storm's End supposedly with the help of the children of the forest or a young boy who would later grow to be Bran the Builder, and the great castle withstood every storm the gods threw at it);</p>
<p>Elenei (daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind, wed a mortal man, Durran, and doomed herself to a mortal's death).
</p>
<p>            Catelyn and her men wait for the brother kings to meet outside the walls of Storm's End. When Stannis arrives, he promises justice for Lord Eddard, though he claims Ned was no friend of his. Stannis also reveals the insult he felt when Robert named Eddard Hand instead of himself, and that he has no quarrel with Renly should his brother concede his claim and lend him his army. Soon Renly arrives for the parley, but it is all Cat can do to keep the two polite. She tries to reason with them that they have a common foe, and need to unite. Stannis names himself the true heir to the iron throne, and names Renly and Robb traitors. When Cat mentions that Robert has two sons, and they are the rightful heirs, Renly laughs for she has not seen the letters Stannis had circulated about Cersei's incest. Cat is shocked, but not surprised. Renly states that if the letter were true, Stannis would have the rightful claim, and suggests that he would even bend the knee to him. But Stannis has no proof, as Jon Arryn died before he could bring the matter before King Robert (Stannis told Jon his suspicions instead of Robert, because he felt his brother would be more inclined to believe the Lord of the Eyrie). </p>
<p>Renly then offers his brother a peach, but that only enrages Stannis further. Renly even offers him Storm's End, but Stannis demands that it is not Renly's to give, it is his by right. When Renly mentions his marriage to the maid Margaery, Stannis states that she is like to remain a maid in Renly's bed. The parley comes to an end, with war imminent at dawn should neither side relent and bend the knee. Later, in Renly's war council, several suggest they leave Stannis to besiege Storm's End, but most agree that war is unavoidable. When Cat asks for leave to return to Riverrun, Renly denies her, wishing her to watch the battle and bring word back to Robb of what happens to rebels. His men then bicker for the right to lead the van, Lord Randyll Tarly claiming he had been leading Mace Tyrell's van since before most of the young knights were born, but Renly grants the right to Ser Loras. Catelyn asks to go to the local temple of the Seven to pray, and Renly grants her wish and commands Ser Robar Royce to escort her. She questions the young son of Lord Yohn, and Ser Robar states that he is far from the Vale because he must earn his reputation somewhere, since his older brother is the heir to their ancestral seat.</p>

<h2>Sansa (III) {IX}   pg 364/485</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Maester Frenken (Lady Stokeworth's maester).
</p>
<p>            Sansa is escorted by the Hound before Joffrey, who berates her for her brother's actions. The king has just learned that Robb's men, and supposedly an army of wargs, fell upon Ser Stafford Lannisters' new army not three days ride from Lannisport, routing the army and killing Ser Stafford. Joff threatens to shoot her with his crossbow, but was told by his mother that if he kills her, they'll kill his uncle Jaime in retaliation. But Joff will have her punished, and commands the Hound to beat her. Ser Dontos tries to prevent this by beating her with a melon, but Joff is not amused. He has Ser Boros and Ser Meryn beat her severely, and even when Sandor yells "Enough", Joff has them tear her clothes off. However, Tyrion arrives, his voice cracking like a whip, "What is the meaning of this?" Tyrion mocks Ser Boros for his notion of chivalry, and when the two Kingsguard begin to draw their swords, Bronn tells them to be careful. The Hound gives Sansa his cloak to cover up her nakedness. Tyrion berates his nephew for his actions, and when Ser Boros warns him not to threaten the king, Tyrion replies, "Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth, kill him. Now that was a threat, ser." </p>
<p>Tyrion continues to berate Joff, telling him brutality to his subjects will lead to his undoing. Tyrion and his men take Sansa to the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion tells her the truth of her brother's actions at Oxcross, how his direwolf caused the horses to go wild and how his men killed Ser Stafford, Ser Rubert Brax, Ser Lymond Vikary, Lord Roland Crakehall and Lord Antario Jast (the last three are actually alive but captives). When Sansa asks about the wargs and sorcery, Tyrion snorts, "Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence." Tyrion tells her that if it is any solace, he does not intend for her to wed Joffrey, realizing that nothing can ever reconcile Stark and Lannister. Sansa is hopeful that Tyrion means what he says, and when Tyrion suggests she wants to be as far from the Lannisters as possible, he smiles and tells her that as a child, he wished for the same thing.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (IV) {XV}   pg 372/495</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Parmen Crane (member of King Renly's Rainbow Guard, the Purple; later joins King Stannis);</p>
<p>Ser Emmon Cuy* (Rainbow Guard of King Renly, the Yellow).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Gawen Wylde* (master-at-arms of Storm's End during the siege, imprisoned by Stannis for trying to surrender to the Tyrell army, died in his cell);</p>
<p>Lady Minisa Tully* (of House Whent, Lord Hoster's wife, died in childbed trying to bear a fourth child, mother of Catelyn, Lysa and Edmure).</p>
<p>Catelyn is praying in the sept and recalls Robert Baratheon's disposition toward his son, and realizes the King would have had Joff killed had he learned the truth. Incest was considered an abomination before both gods and men, with the exception being the Targaryens 'who were the blood of ancient Valyria where such practices were common', and the Targaryens answered to neither gods nor men. Cat also realizes that both Jon Arryn and her husband must have been killed for their knowledge, and that Bran must have seen something as well. At Renly's pavilion, the king demands that no harm come to his brother's corpse, and when someone asks what should be done if he yields, Mathis Rowan laughs, and Renly tells the tale of how during the siege, Stannis intended to have Ser Gawen Wylde and his men catapulted from the battlements for their attempted desertion, and only Maester Cressen was able to reason with him that the men should be kept alive in case the defenders needed to eat them. </p>
<p>Renly sends his men away, and while Brienne dresses him for battle, Catelyn begs Renly to reconsider, and tells him that Bran must have caught Jaime and Cersei at their act. She tells him that Robb would set aside his crown if Renly and Stannis did the same, and they could call for a Great Council, as had not happened in near 100 years. But as Renly is saying that the time for talk is over, a shadow appears in the tent, a shadow that looks like Stannis to Catelyn. A shadow sword is swung, cutting King Renly's throat, and then disappears. In the mayhem that ensues, Ser Robar and Ser Emmon Cuy accuse Brienne of killing Renly, but Catelyn is able to persuade Ser Robar that it was some vile sorcery, a shadow of Stannis that killed the king. Ser Robar agrees to try and hold off the others as Catelyn and Brienne flee the camp.</p>

<h2>Jon (IV) {XIII}   pg 381/507</h2>
<p>Lord Commander Mormont's men arrive at the Fist of the First Men, an ancient ringfort of the First Men during the Dawn Age, an old place, and strong with magic. It is also extremely defendable by its position, and Mormont intends to wait for Qhorin Halfhand's men at the Fist. Ghost will not enter the fortified area of the Fist, despite all Jon's efforts. That night however, Ghost awakens Jon and beckons him to follow. The direwolf leads him to what appears a grave under the shadow of the Fist, but as Jon digs, he realizes that there is something buried there. Inside, he finds several daggers and arrowheads made of dragonglass, and an ancient warhorn. The cache appeared to be buried relatively recently, and it was wrapped in the cloak of a sworn brother of the Night's Watch!</p>

<h2>Bran (V) {XII}   pg 390/519</h2>
<p>Maester Luwin has just received word of Robb's victory at Oxcross, and tells Bran and the Walders that Ser Stevron perished in the battle. The two Walders are not saddened at all by their uncle's death, talking instead of who is now heir to the Twins, and Bran realizes the truth of Jojen's dream, that the Walders are more pleased by this news than he is. Bran tells Jojen that he believes him, and Jojen tells him of another green dream he had, where the salt water flows over the walls of Winterfell, and several men are drowned including Alebelly, Septon Chayle and Mikken. Jojen then asks Bran about his dreams, and Bran tells him that the most common are the wolf dreams, but he also dreams of the crow and of falling. Jojen calls him a warg, or shapeshifter, and that people will fear him or even try to kill him if they find out. Jojen explains that the wolf dreams are Bran's ability to use his third eye while asleep, and that his power is strong. </p>
<p>Bran tries to warn Alebelly and the others of what Jojen saw, but they don't believe him, and the crannogman assured Bran that nothing could be done to avert their deaths. Ser Rodrik soon returns with Reek as his prisoner, a servant of the Bastard of Bolton, whom Ser Rodrik claims was killed in the battle. Lady Hornwood was found dead, but she had signed over her lands to the Boltons, and though Maester Luwin states that vows made at sword point are not valid, Ser Rodrik claims that Roose Bolton may not agree since land is at stake. Bran tells Ser Rodrik of Jojen's dream, and Maester Luwin confirms that raiders have been plundering the Stony Shore. But neither the Maester nor the Castellan believe that what Jojen saw will come to pass. Later, Jojen tells Bran of a new green dream, where the man Reek stands over Bran and Rickon's dead bodies, having skinned their faces. Bran protests as does Meera, but Jojen, with pity in his eyes, tells them nothing they can do will change the truth of the vision.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (VIII) {XVII}   pg 397/528 </h2>
<p>The small council is listening to Varys' report of Renly's death, but the Spider is not sure how Renly died. They bicker over the fact that only a small portion of Renly's army bent the knee to King Stannis, led by Lord Alester Florent. Ser Loras Tyrell and most of the great Lords of Highgarden did not join Stannis, and Tyrion feels there is an opportunity to try and win them over. Varys claims that Ser Loras killed three of the Rainbow Guard in a rage when he found the king dead, including Ser Robar Royce and Ser Emmon Cuy. They decide that a large amount of money and a proposal of marriage between Margaery and King Joffrey may win over Ser Loras and his father, the keys to obtaining the huge host. It is then decided that Littlefinger will treat with the Tyrells, and he requests a three-hundred troop honor guard, gold, a letter of authority and Ser Hobber Redwyne in order to assure Lord Paxter comes over as well with his entire fleet. Afterwards, Cersei kisses Tyrion on the brow and thanks him, but Tyrion knows that it is not due to her affection for him, but rather that she is hatching some plan.</p>

<h2>Theon (III)   pg 404/537</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Benfred Tallhart* (son and heir of Ser Helman Tallhart);</p>
<p>Black Lorren*, Werlag*, Tymor* (Theon's ironmen given to him by his father, later stand with him when Winterfell is besieged by Ser Rodrik);</p>
<p>Stygg, Urzen (ironmen under Theon's command, desert him when Winterfell is besieged);</p>
<p>Gevin Harlaw (one of Theon's men);</p>
<p>Marron Botley (called Fishwhiskers, one of Theon's ironmen);</p>
<p>Todric* (another of Theon's men);</p>
<p>Dagmer Cleftjaw (master-at-arms of Pyke, a famed reaver; later under Theon's command during the raids, later still besieges Torrhen's Square).</p>
<p>Theon is trying to question Benfred Tallhart regarding the disposition of the North, but the young man will not answer the Turncloak's questions. Damphair demands a sacrifice to his God, and Theon's men have Benfred drowned in the salt water. Theon watches his ironmen paying the iron price by looting the corpses of trinkets. He is forced to kill a drunken man in his service who is starting fights over the loot. Theon finds himself remorseful that he had to kill Benfred, who he had once been friendly with. Theon, however, is not satisfied that his uncle and sister will be gaining all the glory, so he convinces Dagmer Cleftjaw, a warrior of great renown on the Iron Islands, to lay siege to Torrhen's Square. It will be a feint to draw out Ser Rodrik, while Theon leads a small band to capture Winterfell.</p>

<h2>Arya (VIII) {XIII}   pg 411/547 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lucan* (blacksmith at Harrenhal).</p>
<p>Lord Tywin Lannister was marching, leaving the castle in the hands of Ser Amory Lorch and Vargo Hoat. There is much talk in the castle about Robb's strike into the heart of the West, but the stories of what actually occurred are mixed. Arya does a favor for Weese and is promised a good dinner, but Weese later slaps her and reneges on his offer. Arya decides to have Weese killed, and goes in search of Jaqen, but bumps into Rorge instead. The criminal with the missing nose accosts her, but when she mentions that she is looking for Jaqen, Arya notices something in Rorge's eyes, something that looked like fear of Jaqen. Arya attempts to walk up to Jaqen quiet as a shadow, but the Lorathi hears her anyway. Arya whispers the name Weese to Jaqen. As Arya watches Lord Tywin's army depart, she curses herself for not whispering the names of Lord Tywin or Ser Gregor to Jaqen, because Weese and Chiswyck were insignificant. Arya tries to find Jaqen in time to change her request, but she finds Weese dead, with his dog that he had raised as a pup tearing out his throat. Arya looks up and sees Jaqen on the battlements, and the man lays two fingers across his cheek casually.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (V) {XVI}   pg 418/557</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Desmond Grell (master-at-arms of Riverrun);</p>
<p>Utherydes Wayn (steward of Riverrun);</p>
<p>Maester Vyman (counselor and healer to the Tullys).</p>
<p>Catelyn and her escort are nearing Riverrun and are met by Martyn Rivers and his outriders. She learns that Robb has crushed Ser Stafford Lannister's levies, and that the Greatjon has seized 3 of the Lannisters' gold mines. Robb reached Oxcross by following a trail Grey Wind had discovered around the Golden Tooth. However, Martyn tells her that Lord Tywin is marching on Riverrun as they speak. Cat makes all haste back to her father's castle, but first takes Brienne as her sworn sword, to prevent the girl from doing anything foolish. Catelyn is fearful of her brother's chances in battle against Lord Tywin, and outside Riverrun discovers Lannisters hanging from the walls. Edmure informs her that 4 men from Ser Cleos' party attempted to free Ser Jaime, and had nearly succeeded. They were hung for their deeds, and the Kingslayer was placed in the deep dungeons and chained to the wall. Edmure also explains that birds had arrived from Storm's End, with messages from Ser Cortnay Penrose seeking help. He claims he fears for the boy, and when he asks who the Castellan meant, Brienne tells him it is Edric Storm, Robert's only known high-born bastard. Cat makes known her dissent in Edmure giving Lord Tywin battle, and he tells her that he has commanded Roose Bolton to take Harrenhal, and has also called the levies from the Twins, those under the command of Ser Helman Tallhart. Cat argues that Robb left those men to make certain Lord Walder kept faith. She learns that Roose Bolton wed one of Lord Walder's daughters.</p>
<p>She then visits her father, but Lord Hoster mistakes her for Lysa, and mumbles several strange, disjointed lines, "Jon's a good man...strong, kind...you'll wed when Cat does...That stripling (Cat reflects that her father said this part with vehemence)...wretched boy...not speak that name to me, your duty..." Cat is then led by Utherydes Wayn to the silent sisters who possess Lord Eddard's bones. She orders them to deliver his body to the crypts beneath Winterfell. When she states that she must thank Cersei for even this much, her father's Steward tells her to thank the Imp, since it was his doing. Cat thinks to herself, One day I will thank them all.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (III) {XIII}   pg 431/574 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mathos Mallarawan, Wendello Qar Deeth, Egon Emeros the Exquisite (members of the Pureborn, descendants of the ancient kings of Qarth).</p>
<p>Dany relates to Xaro how the Pureborn had denied her, despite all the customary bribes. Dany's hope of obtaining ships and men from the Pureborn was a failure, and now she had to move on. The Pureborn were interested only in her dragons, not in her cause. She again beseeches Xaro for ships, but the merchant prince tells her he has no warships. He asks her again to marry him, but Dany realizes that he only wants to obtain one of her dragons. She again considers going to the Warlocks for aid, and again Xaro warns her not to. As they move through the marketplace, Dany witnesses a firemage make a ladder of fire and climb it into the sky, as cutpurses move through the astonished crowd. Xaro declares the feat a fine trick, but Quaithe appears and tells them it was no trick. </p>
<p>The shadowbinder tells Dany that half a year ago, the man could scarcely make even a small fire appear, but his power has grown now, and all because of Dany, the Mother of Dragons. Quaithe warns, "You must leave this city soon...or you will never be permitted to leave it at all." Dany asks her where she would have her go, and Quaithe tells her to Asshai beneath the Shadow, and it is there she will find truth. Her khas warn her not to trust the Asshai'i shadowbinder, and Xaro concurs. Later, Ser Jorah tells her she will find no help in this city. He tells her she should go east, but not to Asshai. When Dany suggests returning west to Illyrio, Jorah warns her that the Magister cares only for himself and would provide no help. Dany believes he will give her the ships and soldiers to retake Westeros, but Jorah states, "Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil."</p>

<h2>Tyrion (IX) {XVIII}   pg 441/587 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Osmund Kettleblack (a hedge knight, later member of King Joffrey and King Tommen's Kingsguard);</p>
<p>Osney and Osfryd Kettleblack (brothers of Ser Osmund working for Queen Cersei, later knighted).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Tygett Lannister* (brother of Lord Tywin and Ser Kevan, father of Tyrek, died of a pox).</p>
<p>Tyrion, the royal family, and their retainers are at the docks to see Princess Myrcella off to Dorne. Tyrion is sending Ser Arys Oakheart with her as her sworn shield. Prince Doran Martell has promised to move his banners into the high passes once Myrcella is safely at Sunspear. Tyrion knows one of Cersei's secrets, how she is consorting with the unsavory hedge knight Ser Osmund Kettleblack and his brothers in order to raise her own force of sellswords. What the Queen didn't know, was that Bronn was matching every copper she gave the Kettleblacks, thus Ser Osmund was really one of Tyrion's men. On the ride back to Maegor's Holdfast, things get out of hand when someone in the crowd hits Joff in the face with dung, and the king sends the Hound to deal with the perpetrator. The crowd, frenzied due to the lack of food and the harsh living conditions, boils over and begins to trample the procession. Sensing what was about to happen, Tyrion screams for them to ride hard for the gates to the Holdfast. In the mad rush, several members are lost, and by the time Tyrion reaches the safety of the gates, their lives are in doubt.</p>
<p>As Joff is ranting about traitors and how they attacked him, Tyrion dismounts and slaps him so hard his crown flies off, and then Tyrion shoves him to the ground, shouting, "You set your dog on them! What did you imagine they would do?" Tyrion commands Ser Boros and Ser Meryn to return and find Sansa and the others missing, and when the two Kingsguard balk, Cersei begins to berate them as well for their cowardice. Sansa returns, saved by Sandor Clegane who is covered in blood. Meanwhile, a fire has broken out in the city, and Tyrion can see the fear in the Hounds eyes when he commands men to go and put out the fire. Later, it is discovered that Ser Preston Greenfield, Ser Aron Santagar, and the High Septon lost their lives; Lady Tanda's slow-witted daughter Lollys is found alive, having been raped by dozens outside a tanner's shop, but Tyrion's cousin Tyrek was missing. Tyrion wants his cousin found, mostly because the boy's father Tygett was always kind to Tyrion. He is dismayed to learn from Ser Jacelyn that many of the City Watch and the commonfolk consider Tyrion the problem in the city, and would revolt given the chance. Later, Bronn mentions to Tyrion while Varys is in the room, that things would be a lot easier if Tommen were king...</p>

<h2>Davos (II)   pg 454/604</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Cortnay Penrose* (Castellan of Storm's End, fostering Edric Storm);</p>
<p>Lord Alester Florent (Lord of Brightwater Keep, uncle of Queen Selyse, brother of Ser Axell Florent, bannerman to Highgarden, joins King Stannis after Renly's death, later Hand of King Stannis and then imprisoned for treason);</p>
<p>Ser Bryan Fossoway* (of the red apple Fossoways);</p>
<p>Lady Shyra Errol (Lady of Haystack Hall, bannerlady to Storm's End, joins King Stannis).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Elwood Meadows (second to Ser Cortnay, later second to the new castellan of Storm's End, Lord of Grassy Vale, a cousin to the Fossoways).</p>
<p>Ser Davos has recently returned to Stannis' fleet after delivering the king's message throughout the realm. He learns that Stannis has been having terrible nightmares, and that only Lady Melisandre can soothe him to sleep. She has been sharing his pavilion of late, and he wonders what ways she has to soothe him to sleep. Ser Cortnay Penrose arrives to parley with Stannis, and he scorns the king and all his new found allies who had so recently been sworn to Renly. He especially mocks Lord Alester Florent, for not only changing sides, but changing gods as well. Ser Cortnay will not accept Stannis' demands, and will not surrender Storm's End nor Robert's bastard Edric Storm. The Castellan throws his gauntlet in King Stannis' face, and proposes single combat to settle the issue. Stannis rejects him, stating he will take the castle by storm if he must, to which Ser Cortnay responds, "Bring on your storm- and recall, if you do, the name of this castle." Stannis dismisses all his men save Davos, and seeks the former smuggler's advice. Davos states his respect for Ser Cortnay, who kept his faith, unlike all these new lords in Stannis' army. Stannis dislikes them as much, but he needs their strength in order to win his throne. Stannis sent Ser Parmen Crane to Bitterbridge to gather the rest of Renly's army, but there was no word since. Stannis tells him that he grieves for his brother Renly, and dreams of a green pavilion and the manner of Renly's death, even though he was in bed at the time of Renly's demise. Stannis says, "...but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother's peach."</p>
<p>Davos tells Stannis to strike for King's Landing at once, but Stannis will not leave Storm's End untaken in his rear, for men will consider him defeated there. Stannis then tells Davos that he must have the boy Edric Storm, Melisandre has seen it in her flames; and she has also seen Ser Cortnay's death in her flames, as she had seen Renly's at Dragonstone. The king commands Davos to bring Melisandre by boat under the cover of darkness beneath Storm's End, as he had done some 15 years before. That night, Davos is sickened by what he must do for his king. He asks Melisandre if she is good or evil, and she responds, "Oh, good. I am a knight of sorts myself. A champion of light and life." Davos calls her a liar, for she means to kill a man this very night, and killed Maester Cressen and Renly as well. The Red Woman responds that the maester poisoned himself, and that she had nothing to do with Renly's death. However, she later admits that Renly was unprotected, but that the walls of Storm's End had spells woven into the stones, and that no shadow can pass from the outside. When Davos proclaims that a shadow is a thing of darkness, Melisandre rebuffs him, stating that shadows don't exist in the dark, they are servants of light and fire, provided by her god, R'hllor. When they arrive at a gate in a water tunnel beneath the castle, Melisandre disrobes, and Davos watches in horror as the now pregnant woman gives birth to a shadow, and Davos recognizes the man who had cast it...</p>

<h2>Jon (V) {XIV}   pg 469/624</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Qhorin Halfhand* (senior ranger from the Shadow Tower, a legend in the Night's Watch and hated by the wildlings).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Alfyn Crowkiller* (wildling leader slain by Qhorin Halfhand).</p>
<p>Jon hears the call of a warhorn, one blast to signify brothers returning. Qhorin Halfhand has arrived, with 100 men from the Shadow Tower. Qhorin recognizes Jon, and tells him that he knew Lord Eddard and Jon's grandfather Lord Rickard as well. The men from the Shadow Tower were delayed because they met Alfyn Crowkiller and his men who had been scouting along the Wall. They killed the wildling leader, but lost four men in the process. Later, Jon overhears dissent in the ranks as Chett and Lark the Sisterman speak of not going into the Frostfangs, no matter what the Old Bear orders. Jon had given the warhorn he had found to Sam, because it was cracked and he could get no sound from it, but Sam liked ancient items. Jon walks in and overhears Qhorin telling Mormont about a captive claiming that Mance had wargs and mammoths in his army. He also explains that the captive claims the wildlings plan to breach the Wall, not climb it or burrow beneath it. Qhorin tells them that Mance is seeking something in the high, cold places of the Frostfangs, some power or artifact. Qhorin tells the Old Bear that they must send scouts into the mountains, and Mormont agrees. Jarmen Buckwell will take four men to climb the Giant's Stair, Thoren Smallwood will lead a party to probe the Milkwater, while Qhorin himself will lead a third party into the Skirling Pass. Qhorin immediately chooses Jon Snow as one of his four men, stating, "The old gods are still strong beyond the Wall. The gods of the First Men...and the Starks."</p>

<h2>Tyrion (X) {XIX}   pg 477/634</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Symon Silver Tongue* (a singer and taleteller).</p>
<p>Tyrion learns from Lancel that the Queen intends to hide Tommen away at Rosby under the care of Lord Gyles. Tyrion is disturbed that Varys had not learned of this, or had decided not to inform him of it. Later, Tyrion has Bronn deliver word to Ser Jacelyn, commanding him to take fifty men and capture Lord Gyles' party, and to expel the garrison and keep Tommen safe at Rosby. He does not want Lord Rosby hurt, nor any killing done in front of Tommen. For this, Ser Jacelyn will earn a lordship. Tyrion then sets out for Chataya's, but then abandons his patience and rides hard for Shae's mansion directly. He finds her listening to a singer, and has the man expelled and sworn to silence. When one of the begging brothers appears, Shae recognizes him as Lord Varys. The Spider informs Tyrion that Storm's End has fallen and that Stannis is now marching on King's Landing.</p>
<p>Alone, Shae tells Tyrion to make her his lady in court, and even suggests he kill Cersei, but Tyrion tells her, "The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men." When Tyrion mentions taking her to the Red Keep and hiding her in the kitchens, Shae balks, and mocks him for being afraid of his father. Tyrion slaps her in the face, telling her never to mock him again. Feeling remorseful, he tells her the story of Tysha and his father's wrath. He departs to meet Varys at the stables, and the eunuch suggests that Shae be placed as a maidservant to Lady Tanda's daughter Lollys. Shae would then be able to access the Tower of the Hand through a secret passage, of which Tyrion is surprised to learn exists. Varys then attempts to tell Tyrion how Ser Cortnay died, and when he suggests it was magic, the Hand disbelieves him. Varys then tells a story of how he came to be a eunuch, that he was a member of a mummers' troupe, and that one day in Myr a certain man bought Varys from his master. The sorcerer castrated Varys, and burned the parts, creating a blue flame from which a voice spoke in a language he didn't comprehend. Varys claims he has hated magic since that day, and means to see Stannis dead if the man practices magic. Tyrion seems to disbelieve the story, but notes how he used to dream of being rich enough one day to hire a Faceless Man to kill his sister.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (VI) {XVII}   pg 488/649 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Rymund the Rhymer (a bard at Riverrun).</p>
<p>Cat reflects on how she has always done her duty, remembering that she had never comforted Littlefinger after Brandon injured him, nor did she bid him farewell when her father sent him off. Later, Maester Vyman shows her a letter from Lord Meadows, the new castellan at Storm's End. The man does not make note of Edric Storm, and she wonders again why Stannis was so interested in the boy, thinking he might mean to use the boy's appearance as proof of Joffrey's ill heritage. Catelyn is considering the nature of bastards and their fathers, and recalls Lord Bolton's recent missive where he calls his bastard, Ramsay Snow, a boy of tainted blood and that he counts himself "well rid of him". Lord Bolton states that he hopes Robb will weigh his capture of Harrenhal against the crimes of his bastard son. </p>
<p>Catelyn is drawn away as fighting begins across the Ruby Fork, yet each time Lord Tywin's troops attempt to cross, Ser Edmure's men crush them, raining arrows down upon them as they attempt to ford the river. Catelyn is unimpressed despite the great victories her brother has won against one of the most famous battlefield commands alive. She sends wine to Ser Cleos, and then attempts to gain information from him, but the man knows little of use. All she learns is that Ser Cleos had seen only Sansa at court. Cat does consider Tyrion a man who might be trusted at his word, despite what had transpired between the two of them. She then learns the results of the great victory, that Lord Leo Lefford had drowned, Ser Gregor badly wounded, and the great knight Strongboar taken captive. Yet despite the fact they were winning, she was still afraid.</p>

<h2>Bran (VI) {XIII}   pg 498 /663      </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ramsay Snow (the Bastard of Bolton, bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton, wed Lady Hornwood then killed her; later legitimized as Ramsay Bolton).</p>
<p>Bran is once again dreaming through the eyes of Summer, and he and his brother can smell something wrong in the air. The direwolf tries to climb a tree to reach the wall, following Bran's thoughts. Summer falls from the tree, and Bran awakes to find a strange man in his room, followed by Theon Greyjoy. Theon tells him that the castle is his now, that his ironmen had swam the moat and unlocked the postern gate. His father's former ward informs him that he must make the people of Winterfell aware that Theon is in command, and that no one will be hurt if they concede. Bran watches as all those whom Jojen had seen in his dream die, and all of the crannogman's words have come true. Most in the castle defy Theon, but Reek and Osha join his service. Bran is able to convince the rest that fighting is not the answer.</p>

<h2>Arya (IX) {XIV}   pg 507/675</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mebble (called Pinkeye, replaces Weese as Understeward);</p>
<p>Ser Aenys Frey (third son of Lord Walder and his first wife, brother of Ser Stevron and Ser Emmon);</p>
<p>Shagwell the Fool (a member of Vargo Hoat's Bloody Mummers).</p>
<p>Arya and Hot Pie are eating tarts in the kitchens, when the Bloody Mummer's return, this time with nearly 100 northmen as prisoners, along with their commander, Robett Glover. Vargo Hoat claims that Lord Roose Bolton fled with his host after the battle. Ser Amory Lorch has the men imprisoned in the Widow's Tower. Arya tries to convince Gendry to help her free the northmen, but the apprentice smith is happy enough where he is and wants no part of it. Arya later goes to the godswood to practice with a wooden stick, and she meets Jaqen H'ghar there. The Lorathi tells her he would have done with his promise, and asks her to name a third. He also knows her to be Arya Stark, and tells her that some people have many names. She asks him to help her free the northmen, but Jaqen reminds her that she has only one name left. When Arya asks if she could name anybody, even the king, Jaqen tells her, "Speak the name, and death will come. On the morrow, at the turn of the moon, a year from this day, it will come. A man does not fly...but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there, and a king dies. A girl whispers if she fears to speak aloud. Whisper it now. Is it Joffrey?" Arya whispers "Jaqen H'ghar", and stuns the man. But Jaqen is unafraid, and a dagger appears in his hand, telling her she would lose her only friend. Arya says that a friend would help her, and Jaqen agrees to help her if she names another name. They go and find Rorge and Biter, and Jaqen tells her, "The hungry gods will feast on blood tonight, if a man would do this thing", but Arya is resolute.</p>
<p>Jaqen brings Arya along, and has her demand several kettles of hot soup from the cooks. Each man takes one of the huge kettles, with Rorge carrying two, and invade the guardtower where the prisoners are kept. Boiling soup flies everywhere as the guards are dispatched, and when Rorge unlocks the door to the cells, Robett Glover thanks them and asks if they are from the Brave Companions. Arya is confused, but has no time to ask him what he meant when fighting breaks out in the great castle. Jaqen wipes blood from his sword on Arya's shift, telling her this is her work. Later, Arya takes back the name, and asks if she still can name a third, but Jaqen tells her she has gotten far more than three deaths. As she watches, Jaqen tells her the debt is paid and that he must die, and his features change as he passes a hand over his face! Arya asks who he is and if she could learn, but Jaqen tells her that she would need to go with him across the narrow sea. He leaves her with a coin, of great value in the right place, and tells her that if she ever needs to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from Braavos, and say "Valar morghulis". Jaqen, who claims his name is as dead as Arry, then disappears into the night.</p>
<p>Later, after the northmen and the Bloody Mummers have secured Harrenhal, Lord Roose Bolton arrives, and Vargo Hoat gives the castle over to him. The prisoners were all a ruse to begin with, and apparently Bolton had bought the services of the Qohorik sellsword. As Roose Bolton takes control of the castle, Shagwell grabs Arya and presents her to her brother's bannerman as the weasel who made the soup. Bolton asks her name, and Arya tells him 'Nan'. The Lord of the Dreadfort then asks if she is afraid of leeches, for he claims that a man must purge himself of bad blood. When Arya tells him she is not afraid, Bolton names her his cupbearer. The banners over the gatehouse are changed to the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of the Starks. Arya watches as the Bloody Mummers parade Ser Amory around naked, then feed him to a caged bear, and she thinks to herself a bear all in black, like Yoren.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (IV) {XIV}   pg 523/696 </h2>
<p>The House of the Undying is a gray and ancient ruin, yet Dany is resolute that she must enter the abode of the Warlocks. Pyat Pree has her drink shade of the evening, from which the Warlocks get their blue lips. He warns her to always follow the door to the right, and the visions she sees in other rooms are the sights and sounds of past days, future days and days that never were. Dany enters the House of the Undying, and notices right away that she is in the presence of sorcery. Fortunately, she brought Drogon with her into the Warlocks home. Dany sees a great many visions during her travel through the halls:</p>
<p>1) a scene where four men with rat faces are raping a beautiful woman;</p>
<p>2) a feast of corpses, where many of the bodies were savagely slaughtered, and many of the corpses have cups or spoons in their hands; above them sits a dead man on a throne with the head of a wolf, wearing an iron crown and holding a leg of lamb like a king would hold a scepter;</p>
<p>3) old, dead, loyal Ser Willem Darry at the house with the red door from when Dany lived in Braavos;</p>
<p>4) a scene where an old man with long silver hair sits on a barbed throne in a great hall with dragon skulls, and says "Let him be the king of ashes";</p>
<p>5) a man who looked like Viserys, but taller and with darker eyes, who says to a woman nursing a baby, "Aegon...What better name for a king...He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire"; and when the man's eyes meet Dany's, he says either to her or the woman with the baby, "There must be one more...The dragon has three heads", and he picks up a silver harp and begins to play;</p>
<p>6) a vision of Pyat Pree telling her the visit was over, and to follow him into a garden;</p>
<p>7) a great hall with several robed people claiming to be the Undying of Qarth, who tell her, "We sent the comet to show you the way (to Qarth)...shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?", but it turns out to be sorcery.</p>
<p>Finally, Dany comes upon a room with several figures that were no more than shadows, unbreathing, and over them floated a human heart, blue and corrupted (these are apparently the real Undying). The figures speak inside Dany's head, saying "we know...the shape of shadows...morrows not yet made...drink from the cup of ice...drink from the cup of fire...mother of dragons...child of three...three heads has the dragon...three fires must you light: one for life and one for death and one to love...three mounts must you ride: one to bed and one to dread and one to love...three treasons will you know: once for blood and once for gold and once for love...daughter of death, slayer of lies, bride of fire..." She now sees visions in her head, floating faster and faster:</p>
<p>1) Viserys dying;</p>
<p>2) a tall lord with copper skin and silver hair bearing the banner of a fiery stallion (probably Rhaego, her unborn son);</p>
<p>3) a dying prince with rubies flying from his armor whispering the name of a woman with his last breath;</p>
<p>4) a blue-eyed king with a red sword in his hand who cast no shadow;</p>
<p>5) a cloth dragon amidst a cheering crowd;</p>
<p>6) a great stone beast flying from a smoking tower, breathing shadow fire;</p>
<p>7) her Silver horse given to her by Drogo at her wedding;</p>
<p>8) a corpse at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, smiling sadly;</p>
<p>9) a blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice;</p>
<p>10) shadows dancing in a tent;</p>
<p>11) a little girl running toward a house with a red door;</p>
<p>12) Mirri Maz Duur shrieking in the flames as a dragon bursts from her;</p>
<p>13) a corpse being dragged behind a silver horse;</p>
<p>14) a white lion running through grass taller than a man;</p>
<p>15) a line of naked crones emerging from a lake, kneeling before Dany beneath the Mother of Mountains;</p>
<p>16) ten thousand slaves crying "Mother" as Dany rode by on her silver.</p>
<p>At this point, the visions turn to nightmare as the Undying try to consume Dany, and she is helpless to stop them until Drogon starts to tear the corrupted heart to pieces. Fleeing from the burning House of the Undying, Pyat Pree attacks her with a dagger, but Drogon interrupts him long enough for Dany to hear Jhogo's whip crack, and then she was in the arms of Ser Jorah.
</p>

<h2>Tyrion (XI) {XX}   pg 533/709</h2>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Gulian Swann (Lord of Stonehelm in the Red Watch on the Cape of Wrath, father of Ser Balon, remains at his castle during the fighting).</p>
<p>Tyrion is dispatching his clansmen into the kingswood to raid Lord Stannis' baggage trains, ambush his scouts, and perform night raids. Tyrion feels he can trust only about a quarter of the 6000 men in the City Watch, and feels unprepared for the coming battle. Tyrion orders Bronn to start burning down the houses along the wall by the quay, feeling that the enemy could scale the wall easier by climbing to the roof of the houses. Tyrion is aware that Winterfell had fallen to the ironmen. Ser Balon Swann had been named to the Kingsguard to replace Ser Preston Greenfield, and Tyrion had approved, but he did not approve of Cersei's choice of Ser Osmund Kettleblack to replace Ser Arys Oakheart. Ser Boros Blount had been stripped of his white cloak after he had surrendered Tommen immediately when Ser Jacelyn's men overtook them. Ser Boros was rotting in Lord Rosby's dungeon on the count of treason, since the Kingsguard are supposed to give their lives in defending the royal family. </p>
<p>Tyrion had appointed the new High Septon, and told him to warn the people that Stannis meant to burn the Great Sept of Baelor. Tyrion also visits the Alchemists' Guild, and is surprised to learn that they have 13,000 jars of wildfire, way ahead of schedule. When Tyrion asks Hallyne why, the pyromancer explains that their spells have been more potent of late, and was at a loss to explain why. He does ask Tyrion if there were any dragons about, and elaborates something he had heard a long time ago, that magic had begun to go out of the world when the last dragon died. Lord Jacelyn informs Tyrion that Tommen is safe, but the Hand does not know where the boy will be kept in case he is captured and tortured by the invaders. Varys then informs Tyrion of a plot by several merchants calling themselves Antler Men to arm commoners in the streets. Tyrion writes the order for their arrest, one of them being Salloreon, the master smith.</p>

<h2>Theon (IV)   pg 541/720</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Squint*, Drennan*, Aggar*, Gynir Rednose*, Gelmarr the Grim* (Theon's ironmen);</p>
<p>Murch*, Gariss* (Winterfell huntsmen [this is a different Murch]).</p>
<p>Theon, who had been having bad dreams of late, notices the absence of the direwolves' howling one night, and sends men to investigate. Urzen and Black Lorren return to inform Theon that the wolves are gone along with both boys, and that a couple of his ironmen were killed outside the Hunter's Gate. Theon had sent a man to fetch help from his sister at Deepwood Motte, but help was far off. He learns that both Reeds, Hodor, and Osha are missing as well, and Theon curses himself for trusting the wildling woman. He has the people of Winterfell gather and demands to know the whereabouts of Bran and Rickon. When no one responds, Reek tells Theon to strip off their skins, as Lord Bolton used to say "a naked man has few secrets, but a flayed man's got none". Theon considered what he knew of the Boltons, that their lords used to wear cloaks made from the skins of their enemies, and several Starks 'had ended thus'. Supposedly, that had stopped a thousand years ago when the Boltons bent the knee to Winterfell. </p>
<p>Theon then sets out with several of his men, and brings along a couple of huntsmen from Winterfell, as well as Maester Luwin since he could not be trusted if left alone. Little Walder comes too, saying he wants a wolfskin cloak. They track the boys into the wolfswood, but lose the trail by a stream. No matter how hard they search, the hounds cannot regain the trail, and they begin to head back to Winterfell, with Theon despairing himself how he can reverse the indignity of losing the boys, especially with Asha soon to arrive. Theon did not want to appear weak before his sister, and Reek comes to the rescue by showing him the contents of a bag he was carrying, and suggesting the boys are hiding at the old mill on the Acorn Water. Theon is somehow sure they're there, and sends the others back to Winterfell, telling Maester Luwin he will show no mercy to the boys since his patience had worn out.</p>

<h2>Jon (VI) {XV}   pg 553/736</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Dalbridge* (Squire and senior ranger of the Night's Watch, a marksman archer);</p>
<p>Ebben* (ranger of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Stonesnake (ranger and climber of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Ygritte* (wildling woman spared by Jon).</p>
<p>Legends: Bael the Bard (legendary wildling King-beyond-the-Wall, infiltrated Winterfell calling himself Sygerrik of Skagos, impregnated the king's daughter, the wildlings claim his blood exists in both the wildlings and the Starks);</p>
<p>Brandon the Daughterless (legendary Stark King of Winter, lost his daughter only to find her alive and with Bael's child).</p>
<p>As Qhorin's party moves through the Skirling Pass, they note watchers high up in the pass. Qhorin sends Stonesnake and Jon to dispatch the watchers, and they were warned not to let them sound a horn. Stonesnake teaches Jon how to climb a sheer cliff face, and they eventually reach the top above the wildlings. There were three, and after killing two, the third turns out to be a woman. She yields to them, and Jon takes her captive, despite Stonesnake's warning that she should be killed. When she learns that Jon is a bastard son of a Stark lord, she tells him the wildling story of Bael the Bard. Supposedly, before he joined the free folk, he was a raider, or, according to Stonesnake, a murderer and robber. </p>
<p>The Stark King wanted Bael's head, but was never successful in capturing the bandit. To teach the king a lesson, Bael slipped into Winterfell calling himself Sygerrik, which means 'deceiver' in the old tongue of the First Men, which the giants still speak. In return for his performance, he requests the fairest flower in Winterfell, and the king gave him the rare winter rose. In the morning, the singer was gone along with King Brandon's daughter. A year later, the king's daughter is found in her bedchamber with a young baby. Bael had hidden her in the crypts of Winterfell. Thirty years later when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the wildlings south, it was his son, the new Stark King, who slew Bael, since the bard would not harm his son. Upon returning home, the young king's mother killed herself when she found out Bael was dead. Jon does not believe the story, which claims that the blood of the Starks and the wildlings are the same. When Qhorin and the others arrive, Ygritte recognizes the Halfhand and confirms that the wildlings would kill him if he yielded. Qhorin's men state that she should be killed, and Qhorin leaves Jon alone with Ygritte to carry out the task. Ygritte tells Jon that Mance would accept him if he ran off with her. Jon, about to behead her, finally stops himself and tells her to run off.</p>

<h2>Sansa (IV) {X}   pg 564/750</h2>
<p>Sansa meets again with Ser Dontos in the godswood, and learns that he hears more things as a fool then he ever did as a knight. And Varys the Spider pays in gold for anything overheard, making Dontos believe Moon Boy has been working for Varys for years. Dontos tells her that Stannis burned the sept at Storm's End at the behest of the Red Woman. When Sansa asks him to make good on his promise, Dontos tells her the time is not right for their escape. Dontos does promise her that when his friend returns to King's Landing, they will have a ship to escape on. On her way back to her room, Sansa is grabbed by the Hound. Clegane is in a foul mood as ever, and tells her that he enjoys killing, and that only cowards fight with fire. He claims he fears no man, but Sansa thinks that he does fear his brother. Once again, he assures her that there are no true knights. </p>
<p>That night, Sansa has a dream where she is surrounded by a mob, and calls out to all the great knights, but none respond to her call. She feels herself bleeding, and awakes to find the sheets soaked with blood. She realizes that she just had her first flowering, and burns the sheets in fear that Joffrey would find out and want to bed her. Her maids find out and bring her before the Queen, but Cersei comforts her, knowing the girl is frightened at the prospect of marrying Joff. She tells him how difficult he was to bear, and how Robert was out hunting when Joff was born. Cersei informs her that while she may not love Joff, she will love the children she bears him. The Queen also reveals that Robert had always wanted to be loved, to have friends and be cheered, and that her brother Tyrion had the same disease.</p>

<h2>Jon (VII) {XVI}   pg 573/762</h2>
<p>Jon tells Qhorin what Ygritte had said to him about Mance Rayder accepting him if he ran off. Qhorin confirms this. Qhorin knew Mance when he was a black brother, and the ranger tells Jon that Mance loved songs and wildling women, and that he was a wildling captured as a child by the Watch. He was the best ranger they had, but he returned to his roots, some say to gain a crown. Qhorin suspects that Jon let Ygritte go, and Jon confirms that he did, however Qhorin understands that the girl was not a threat, and if he had wanted her dead he would have had Ebben do it, or have done it himself. Qhorin tells Jon that he now knows him better than he did, and that it was important for a commander to know his men.</p>
<p>They were traveling at night and resting during the day. That morning, the young man dreams of five direwolves, when there should have been six. Seeing through the eyes of Ghost, he finds himself in a forest and senses a voice calling his name from a nearby weirwood, one that resembled his brother except it had three eyes. His brother explains to him how to open his eyes, and the tree reaches down and touches him, and he finds himself back in the mountains. He is atop a cliff, and oversees thousands of men training for combat, and he also sees mammoths with giants riding them. Suddenly, an eagle soars out of the sky coming straight for him. Jon awakens shouting Ghost's name. The others hear his shout, and he tells them what he sees. Qhorin calls it a wolf dream, and Ebben calls Jon a skinchanger. Qhorin, however, does not balk at the thought of wargs and giants during a time when the dead walk and the trees have eyes again. They set out at just before dusk, and spot an eagle watching them, well out of bowshot. Soon after, they find Ghost and dress the direwolf's wounds. Qhorin tells them they must head back to the Fist, for they have been seen by the eagle which they fear is a skinchanger as well. They begin the journey back through the Skirling Pass without lighting any fires despite the cold. But their lead on the enemy was shortening, and when they came upon the place where the wildlings were killed, Squire Dalbridge remains behind with all their arrows, sacrificing himself to give the others an advantage.</p>

<h2>Tyrion (XII) {XXI}   pg 581/772</h2>
<p>Varys shows Tyrion a message from Winterfell that reveals Bran and Rickon were killed at the hands of Theon Greyjoy. Tyrion goes to tell Cersei the news, wanting very much to see her reaction. She tells him she could have frightened Bran into silence, but Jaime reacted without thinking. Tyrion tells her that they must take good care of Sansa, because with two of her sons dead, Lady Catelyn might decide to kill Jaime. Cersei warns him that he trusts Varys too much, telling him that the Spider feeds them all information to make them think they would be helpless without him. She reveals that Varys told her Tyrion meant to take the Hound from Joffrey, and Tyrion explains he needs Sandor Clegane and Ser Balon Swann to lead sorties in the upcoming battle. Tyrion also informs her he means to give Joff a small command far out of the main fighting, so that the men can see their King leading them. </p>
<p>Cersei then springs a surprise on Tyrion, bringing out who she thinks is Tyrion's whore, Alayaya. The girl has been badly beaten, and the Queen reveals she did this because a Lannister always pays his debts, and Tyrion had been conspiring against her since he arrived. Tyrion pretends to be horrified, but is relieved that his sister had not found Shae. Cersei tells him the whore will not be harmed so long as Tommen remains safe, but Tyrion bluffs by saying he will have Tommen treated the same way the girl is. Alayaya does not give Tyrion away, and goes along with the whole thing. Tyrion then threatens to pay Cersei back for what she did, when she least expects it. Having lost, the Queen shouts at him to get out. He finds Shae in his room, having come through the secret passage, but she was blindfolded by Varys and does not know where the entrance lies.</p>

<h2>Catelyn (VII) {XVIII}   pg 589/783</h2>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Gawen Westerling (Lord of the Crag, bannerman to the Lannisters);</p>
<p>Jeffory Mallister*, Kyle Royce* (friends of Brandon, killed by command of King Aerys II);</p>
<p>Elbert Arryn* (companion of Brandon, nephew and heir of Lord Jon Arryn, slain by command of King Aerys).</p>
<p>Catelyn hears the celebration going on in Riverrun, but she sits alone and desolate over the loss of her two young sons. The raven had arrived that morning, and Cat was beside herself with grief. She tells Brienne that she sent the Kingslayer a bottle of wine to loosen his tongue. She means to question him, and is perhaps contemplating having the man killed since she has so little to live for anymore. At midnight, Cat goes to interrogate Jaime, and asks Brienne to wait outside. Jaime mocks her at first, but eventually agrees to answer her questions if she agrees to answer his. Jaime admits to being the father of all Cersei's children, and to throwing Bran out the tower window. However, Jaime denies sending the assassin after Bran, saying, "if I wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself." Cat questions him about the dagger that Littlefinger claimed Tyrion had won from him. Jaime backs what Tyrion told her in the Mountains of the Moon, that he always bet on his brother and had lost at that tourney. Jaime admits that King Robert had mocked him with the dagger at the feast the night of the tourney, and Catelyn is dismayed that Littlefinger, who had been like a brother to her once, would deceive her the way he had.</p>
<p>Cat then reveals that Robb had recently taken the Crag from the Westerlings, and marched ever closer to Casterly Rock. Jaime then steers the conversation to what really happened to Brandon Stark and Lord Rickard at the hands of Mad King Aerys, perhaps to absolve himself of having slain the king. Brandon was on his way to Riverrun when he learned of Lyanna, and had gone to King's Landing. Rhaegar was not there to answer the challenge, and Aerys had Brandon and his men arrested. Aerys demanded the fathers of the men come to King's Landing to stand trial. Both fathers and sons were slain at the command of King Aerys, with Brandon dying of strangulation trying to reach his father who was being burnt alive by Aerys' pyromancers. Jaime was a young member of the Kingsguard when he saw all this, and it was Ser Gerold Hightower who told him, "You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge him." And Jaime admits that the White Bull was a better man than he. Jaime, now fully drunk, begins to mock Ned Stark's honor, a man who fathered a bastard, but Catelyn has heard enough, and calls for Brienne's sword.</p>

<h2>Theon (V)   pg 602/800</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Kromm*, Cadwyl (ironmen under Theon's command).</p>
<p>Theon is having another nightmare when Reek awakens him to inform him of his sister's arrival in Winterfell. He had been having nightmares of the evening he and Reek had killed the boys at the old mill and mounted their tarred heads on the gates of Winterfell. Theon is concerned because several of his men have mysteriously turned up dead recently. Asha has arrived with only 20 men, and she berates him for a fool for the slaughter of two innocent children, both of whom were princes. Asha plans to leave him only ten men, despite Theon's protests that the remainder of the North is mobilizing against him, and that Dagmer was defeated at Torrhen's Square, allowing Ser Rodrik to begin marching back to Winterfell. Asha tells him he should have burnt Winterfell to the ground and brought the two princes to Pyke as hostages. Asha again calls him a fool for his actions, but gives him one last chance to burn Winterfell and return to Deepwood Motte with her. Theon will not hear of it, not wishing to give up his prize. He tells his sister he killed the boys to pay for Rodrik and Maron, hoping his father would approve. Asha departs in disgust. Reek asks Theon for his permission to return to the Dreadfort and gather men to help him protect Winterfell. Theon, desperate for men, agrees.</p>
<p>That night, Theon dreams of the night King Robert feasted at Winterfell, nearly two years before. But all the diners were dead, Robert with his guts spilling out, Lord Eddard headless, and dozens of others Theon had known. But there were others he had never met, a sad girl with a crown of winter roses who could only be Lyanna, Ned's brother Brandon and father Rickard. And then Robb entered the hall with Grey Wind at his side, both bleeding from dozens of savage wounds. Theon awakes, and goes outside; thinking that the castle belonged to the Starks and that he should have gone with his sister. He stares at the heads above the gatehouse, and reflects on what fools people are when they look with their hearts and not their eyes. The heads on the wall were from the miller's sons, for Theon and Reek had never found Bran and Rickon...</p>

<h2>Sansa (V) {XI}   pg 611/811</h2>
<p>Sansa watches as the men mount up for the coming battle, three of the Kingsguard to accompany Joffrey and Tyrion. Sansa prays in the Great Sept, and then goes to Maegor's Holdfast where the highborn ladies and older men of the court will await the results of the battle. Sansa sees Ser Ilyn Payne, and when she asks the Queen why the headsman was there, Cersei tells her to defend them and to deal with treason. Sansa inquires about the other guards, and Cersei informs her there is no such thing as a loyal sellsword. Sansa says that true knights would never harm women and children, but Cersei scoffs and tells her to wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight.</p>

<h2>Davos (III)   pg 617/819</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Imry Florent* (Lord High Captain of King Stannis' fleet, brother of Queen Selyse, nephew of Lord Alester Florent);</p>
<p>Maric* (Ser Davos' fourth son, oarmaster of Fury);</p>
<p>Matthos* (Ser Davos' third son, second-in-command of Davos' ship Black Betha).</p>
<p>Davos' ship Black Betha is in the second line on the right as Stannis' great fleet enters Blackwater Bay. He sees that the city defenders have few enough ships, but the shore is well fortified, and dozens of catapults and archers line the walls of the cities. Davos is glad to know that Stannis sent Melisandre back to Dragonstone, because the king feared the commonfolk would talk that it was the sorceress who won the battle. As they pass two winch towers on either side of the headwaters of the channel entering the Blackwater Rush, Davos fears a chain boom, which he sees exists, but it is not raised. The old sailor is curious, but there is little time to consider what it means. Fighting breaks out, and despite his inexperience, Ser Imry Florent's battle plans seem to be working well, until the barge with the wildfire in it explodes. The channel turns into a ruin of hundreds of ships, many burning from the unquenchable green liquid. Davos goes overboard as hundreds of both Stannis' and Joffrey's men die screaming in the green blaze. As the mass of ships and debris begin to float back out to sea and Davos hopes he can reach the open sea, he sees the great chain boom raised closing off the Blackwater Rush!</p>

<h2>Tyrion (XIII) {XXII}   pg 630/837 </h2>
<p>Tyrion watches in satisfaction as Stannis' fleet is largely on fire in the Blackwater Rush. However, several ships did reach the quay and landed men. Tyrion sends Joff off to the catapults were the boy king was looking forward to launching the Antler Men into the fray. Tyrion gets word that there is a large force attempting to batter down the King's Gate. When he arrives there, he orders the Hound to go out there, but Clegane refuses. Tyrion realizes that the man is afraid of the wildfire, as well as being worn out and covered in blood from the fighting. Tyrion is forced to rally the troops himself, finally succeeding and leads a sortie through the gate to stop Stannis' men.</p>

<h2>Sansa (VI) {XII}   pg 636/844</h2>
<p>Cersei continues to receive word on the progress of the battle from one of the Kettleblacks. Slightly drunk, the Queen tells Sansa that there would be no hope of her charming Stannis Baratheon should the city fall, and explains that women have another weapon beside tears. From Cersei's words, it can be implied that she is bitter that she was born a woman, and wishes she could wield a sword like her brother. The Queen commands her son be brought back to Maegor's as the battle seems to be going in Stannis' favor. As Sansa begins to cry, Cersei tells her that Ser Ilyn is there for them, for she will not permit Stannis to take them alive...</p>

<h2>Tyrion (XIV) {XXIII}   pg 642/852</h2>
<p>Tyrion, with Ser Balon Swann and Ser Mandon Moore at his side are cutting through Stannis' forces. He is confused to see such a large force of men to the west, seemingly fighting Stannis' men, and can't figure out where they came from. But he has little time to consider it, as he sees hundreds of Stannis' troops crossing the Blackwater by using the half-sunk ships as a bridge. Racing onto the boats, Tyrion's men are overwhelmed, and he goes over the edge of a gunwale, clinging for his life. Ser Mandon Moore appears and tells Tyrion to take his hand, his left hand. As Tyrion reaches for his hand, he instinctually withdraws as Ser Mandon's sword slices into his face. Tyrion, grieviously wounded, watches as Podrick Payne saves his life by killing Ser Mandon Moore.</p>

<h2>Sansa (VII) {XIII}   pg 649/861</h2>
<p>Ser Lancel is cursing Cersei for calling her son back inside the Holdfast, when the king's face might have rallied the troops. He claims all is lost, and Cersei leaves the room. Sansa watches as Lancel falls to his knees, severely injured. Dontos persuades her to lock herself in her room, and when Sansa arrives at her chambers, she finds Sandor Clegane hiding in the shadows. The Hound, drunk and battered from the fighting, tells her he lost, and that he should have killed Tyrion years ago. Sandor claims he is leaving the city, maybe to head north somewhere. Clegane forces her to look at him, and then tells her, "I could keep you safe...No one would hurt you again, or I'd kill them." He then asks that she sing for him, as she had promised she would. After singing, some instinct makes her cup his cheek with her fingers, and she can feel tears on his cheeks. Sandor strips off his white cloak and leaves her room. Later, Dontos returns to bring her the news- the war is over, King's Landing has been saved by the Tyrells and Lord Tywin and all their men. Lord Tywin held the right wing, Lord Randyll Tarly the center, and Mace Tyrell commanded the left. Yet it was the vanguard that won the battle, some say led by the ghost of King Renly who slew Ser Guyard Morrigen in single combat.</p>

<h2>Daenerys (V) {XV}   pg 656/870</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Belwas (called Strong Belwas, former warrior in the fighting pits of Meereen, a eunuch, sent by Magister Illyrio to help Dany).</p>
<p> Legends: King Aenys I (2nd of the Targaryen kings after his father Aegon the Dragon, son of Aegon and Rhaenys, the entire Targaryen line descended from him; father of Jaehaerys I);</p>
<p>King Jaehaerys I (4th of the Targaryen kings, called the Old King, the Conciliator, son of Aenys, grandson of Aegon the Dragon and Rhaenys; ruled for 55 years, longer than any other Targaryen king).</p>
<p>Dany considers the defeat of the Undying Drogon's victory. However, Xaro warns her that the Warlocks are gathering their power to come for her, and that the other two great merchant consortiums want her either expelled from the city, or killed outright. Dany realizes she must flee, for Xaro's protection can only go so far. The merchant again asks her to marry him, but this time Dany learns that what Xaro really wants is one of the dragons. Dany tells him that it would cost one-third of all the ships in the world in order for her to give up one of her dragons. Xaro leaves, and Dany questions Ser Jorah about some of the mysteries she saw in the House of the Undying. Jorah says that three heads of the dragon represents Aegon and his two sisters, but Dany is not convinced. The knight confirms that Rhaegar did play a silver harp, but he says that if the Prince's son was the promised one in the vision, the infant Aegon was killed during the sack of King's Landing. Jorah has no knowledge of the song of ice and fire.</p>
<p>Dany later sets out with the exiled knight and her bloodriders to find ships to take her from Qarth. Along the docks, Ser Jorah warns her that two men are following them. When a merchant hands her a beautiful box as a gift, Dany opens it to find a green scarab within. The creature within the box flies out, and mayhem erupts. The creature would have bit Dany had it not been for the old man with the staff who had been following them. The merchant was a Sorrowful Man, and the creature a manticore that would have killed Dany had it bitten her. They learn that the old man is Arstan, and the huge, scarred eunuch is Strong Belwas, both sent by Magister Illyrio to return them to Pentos. Dany concedes that she must leave Qarth, but commands them to change the names of their three ships to that of Aegon's three dragons. The old man recognizes Mormont, and the exile recognizes him but cannot place a name. Arstan claims he comes from the Seven Kingdoms, and had squired for a knight of House Swann as a young man. The two claim that Illyrio sent for them because he wishes to have her dragons in order to bring justice to the Seven Kingdoms, which are a divided and warring realm.</p>

<h2>Arya (X) {XV}   pg 667/885</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Elmar Frey (fourth son of Lord Walder and his seventh wife, betrothed to Arya although she does not know it);</p>
<p>Ser Harys Haigh (eldest son of Perriane Frey [daughter of Lord Walder and his first wife] and Ser Leslyn Haigh);</p>
<p>Qyburn (disgraced maester of the Citadel for dabbling in necromancy, advisor to Vargo Hoat and Lord Roose Bolton, later replaces Pycelle as Cersei's Grand Maester).</p>
<p>Arya, now serving Lord Bolton, is bothered by the killing of many of the servants under Lord Tywin. Arya does not wish to reveal herself to the Lord of the Dreadfort, even though she knows the man to be one of Robb's bannermen. Arya overhears a meeting between Lord Bolton and his advisors, mainly Freys. The Freys believe that Robb will lose, and that they should sue for peace and leave Harrenhal. Bolton states that he is not a man to be undone, like Stannis Baratheon was. Arya learns that Winterfell has fallen and is horrified when she finds out that her brothers are dead. Bolton dismisses the Freys, and has Arya remove the leeches. Qyburn, expelled from the Citadel for dabbling in necromancy, reads a letter from the Lady Walda, Bolton's new wife. Bolton orders the letter burned, and a message sent to Ser Helman Tallhart, who had recently taken Castle Darry from the Lannisters. Bolton orders him and Robett Glover to burn the castle and put the people within to the sword in the name of King Robb, and then to strike east for Duskendale. Bolton says that both men will wish vengeance for what has transpired to their families and homes in the North.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Dreadfort then announces that he will hunt wolves that day, for he cannot sleep with all the howling at night. That evening, Bolton returns with nine dead wolves, and tells Arya that he means to give Harrenhal to Vargo Hoat when he returns to the north! Arya is to remain at Harrenhal to serve the Goat. Outside the tower occupied by the Freys, she hears much shouting within and sees Elmar crying on the steps. The young son of Lord Walder says, "We've been dishonored. There was a bird from the Twins. My lord father says I'll need to marry someone else." Elmar was promised a princess originally, but whether or not he knows it to be Arya is unknown. Arya then decides to flee Harrenhal, and eventually convinces Gendry and Hot Pie to come with her. That night, Arya is forced to kill one of the guards from the Dreadfort, and the three ride out through a sally port and away from Harrenhal.</p>

<h2>Sansa (VIII) {XIV}   pg 681/904 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Mace Tyrell (Lord of Highgarden, Warden of the South, Defender of the Marches, High Marshal of the Reach, father of Ser Loras and Margaery, later a member of Joffrey's small council);</p>
<p>Ser Garlan Tyrell (called the Gallant, second son of Lord Mace, brother of Ser Loras, later named Lord of Brightwater Keep);</p>
<p>Lord Paxter Redwyne (Lord of the Arbor, bannerman to the Tyrells, father of Ser Horas and Ser Hobber);</p>
<p>Ser Philip Foote (a one-eyed hedge knight, slew Lord Bryce Caron in single combat, later named Lord of House Foote and granted the lands of House Caron);</p>
<p>Willit (an old man-at-arms in the service of Ser Harys Swyft);</p>
<p>Josmyn Peckledon (a squire who distinguished himself in the Battle of the Blackwater, to be knighted when he comes of age);</p>
<p>Ser Bonifer Hasty (Ser Bonifer the Good, a famed knight);</p>
<p>Ser Dermot of the Rainwood, Ser Timon the Scrapesword (hedge knights in the service of King Stannis, later captives at King's Landing, then sworn to the Iron Throne);</p>
<p>Aurane Waters (the bastard of Driftmark, later named Admiral by Cersei);</p>
<p>Lord Willum (Lord of  ?, father of Josua and Elyas);</p>
<p>Lord Alesander Staedmon (called Pennylover, Lord of Broad Arch, bannerman to the Baratheons).</p>
<p>Sansa watches the long procession of heroes and captives being presented before the King. Lord Tywin is now Hand, and many are rewarded for their service to House Lannister during the Battle of the Blackwater, with over 600 new knights made. Ser Loras Tyrell is named a member of Joffrey's Kingsguard, Margaery is betrothed to Joffrey (freeing Sansa from her commitment, to her great relief), and Lord Mace Tyrell is named to the King's small council. Many of the great lords sworn to Casterly Rock and Highgarden receive honors, and many hedge knights and freeriders as well. Lothor Brune is knighted, and called Apple-Eater for defeating several Fossoways; Ser Philip Foote is granted the lands of Lord Bryce Caron and elevated to lord. Hallyne the Pyromancer is named lord, but given no lands, and Ser Lancel is named lord and given the land of the Darrys, except he may die or lose his arm from the wounds he suffered. Littlefinger is granted Harrenhal and named Lord Paramount of the Trident for negotiating the treaty which brought the Tyrells to the aid of King's Landing. When the captives were brought in, many swear fealty to Joffrey, but several were killed for openly ridiculing the King and refusing to bend the knee. Later that night, Sansa goes to the godswood and meets Ser Dontos, who is sad because the Queen still has plans for Sansa, and that escape will be impossible while the Queen is watching. However, Dontos does reveal that they will escape during Joffrey's wedding in about a month. Dontos then gives her a hair net that resembed a silver spiderweb with amethysts in it. The fool tells her to wear it, for "It's magic, you see. It's justice you hold. It's vengeance for your father. It'shome."</p>

<h2>Theon (VI)   pg 690/916</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Endehar (one of Asha's ironmen she donated to Theon);</p>
<p>Dykk Harlaw*, Red Rolfe*, Ulf the Ill*, Harrag Sheepstealer*, Kenned the Whale* (ironmen under Theon's command, stand with him when Winterfell is besieged).</p>
<p>Maester Luwin warns Theon to yield when Ser Rodrik arrives, for there will be no siege. Theon has too few men to hold the castle against two thousand men. The Maester advises that Lord Balon is concerned about Moat Cailin, because the North will be won or lost there, not at Winterfell. Luwin tells him to ask for mercy, but Theon will not hear of it. Only seventeen of his men stay with him, the rest desert along with all ten of Asha's men. Even the men who remain loyal have contempt for him, and his plan to stay Ser Rodrik's hand. When the old Castellan surrounds the castle, Theon comes out to parley. Ser Rodrik gives him the chance to die honorably, but Theon pulls out his trump card: Beth Cassel, with a noose around her neck. Ser Rodrik is horrified, but he is too honorable to withdraw, and tells Theon he has has until sunset before he storms the walls.</p>
<p>Later, Theon is practicing archery, knowing he cannot win, when Maester Luwin tells him there is a way he can live through this: yield, and take the black. Theon decides that he will take the black and perhaps save some of his dignity and honor, but he never gets the chance. Fighting has broken out between several hundred men from the Dreadfort and Ser Rodrik's. The Dreadfort men win because they are at first accepted as additional men until they begin slaughtering Ser Rodrik's troops. Theon meets their leader, who he identifies as Reek, but learns the man all along had been Ramsay Snow. The bastard prefers to call himself Ramsay Bolton, and we learn that he had a ring given to him by his father which allowed him certain authority at the Dreadfort. The Bastard of Bolton knocks Theon out cold with a punch to the face, and then commands his men, "Save me the Freys and burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all."</p>

<h2>Tyrion (XV) {XXIV}   pg 701/931 </h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Maester Ballabar (Lord Paxter Redwyne's maester).</p>
<p>Tyrion lies abed dreaming of the men who died fighting alongside him in the battle, as well as those he killed. He dreams of Tysha as well, and when he awakens, realizes that he is not at the Tower of the Hand, and the maester hovering over him is one he does not recognize. Unable to speak, the maester gives him milk of the poppy. Later, when the maester returns, Tyrion knocks the poppy from his hands and demands the cast be removed from his face. Maester Ballabar keeps mumbling about the Queen's orders, but Tyrion will not listen. He demands wine not poppy, and looks upon his destroyed face in a mirror. Three-quarters of his nose is gone along with part of his lip, and the stitching job was sloppy. Tyrion sends the maester away and asks for Podrick Payne. The boy arrives, and Tyrion swears him to silence about what occurred at the docks with Ser Mandon Moore. He tells Pod to bring Maester Frenken, for he does not trust this new maester.</p>

<h2>Jon (VIII) {XVII}   pg 709/942</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Rattleshirt (the Lord of Bones, a wildling warrior of some renown);</p>
<p>Ragwyle (a wildling spearwife).</p>
<p>Fleeing back through the Skirling Pass, the weather has gotten worse, and Qhorin sends Ebben back with the last garron to reach the Lord Commander with all haste while the rest try to head off pursuit. Watched by the eagle, Qhorin then sends Stonesnake back as well, to take the high passes to reach the Fist of the First Men. Qhorin commands Stonesnake to tell Mormont all that Jon saw, and that he faces giants and wargs and worse, and that the trees have eyes again. That night, the Halfhand asks Jon if his sword is sharp, and makes the young man recite his oath with him. Qhorin then commands Jon to yield when they are overtaken, and not to balk no matter what the wildlings ask him to do to prove himself. Jon is appalled at the suggestion, but Qhorin tells him to go among the wildlings and learn what they plan, watch what they do, but to remember who he is and to return to Mormont when he has learned what the wildlings are searching for. Qhorin promises to tell the Lord Commander that Jon never broke his oath when he sees him again.</p>
<p>They are overtaken soon after by Rattleshirt and a party of wildlings, Ygritte amongst them. They have Ebben's head, and Rattleshirt orders them killed. Jon yields, as Qhorin ordered him to, and the Halfhand says in contempt, "I was warned bastard blood is craven." Rattleshirt commands Jon to kill Qhorin to prove himself. Jon slays the big ranger only after Ghost gives him an opening by biting the man's calf. The wildlings accept him despite Rattleshirt's misgivings, and Ygritte tells him that the eagle was once the man he killed up in the passes when they captured her.</p>

<h2>Bran (VII) {XIV}   pg 719/956</h2>
<p>Legends: Edwyn the Spring King, Brandon the Bad, Walton the Moon King, Edderion the Bridegroom, Eyron Stark, Jorah Stark, Jonos Stark, Benjen the Sweet, Benjen the Bitter, King Edrick Snowbeard (ancient Kings in the North, buried in the crypts beneath Winterfell);</p>
<p>Theon Stark (the Hungry Wolf, legendary King of Winter).</p>
<p>Jojen wakes Bran from a wolf dream, and warns him that he's spending too much time as Summer, and that while the wolf eats in the dreams, Bran does not. Bran informs them that Winterfell has been burned to the ground and is all ash except for the stone walls. They had been hiding in the crypts all this time. Trusting Bran's vision, they decide it is now safe to come out of hiding. Hodor moves a massive stone blocking the door from the crypts, and they indeed find Winterfell in ashes. They find several of Theon's ironmen, along with men bearing the badge of the Dreadfort.</p>
<p>The direwolves rejoin them, and lead them to Maester Luwin who lies near death in the godswood, which is still largely untouched. Jojen says, "There is power in living wood, a power strong as fire." The maester is thankful that the boys are still alive, although he knew that Theon had killed the miller's boys from their looks, but had never revealed his knowledge to Theon. Maester Luwin admits that he is dying, and provides his last advice. He tells Osha not to send the boys off together, they are Robb's heirs and must be separated. Osha asks him where to bring the boys, but Luwin is unsure, with the ironmen to the west, the Bastard of Bolton to the east, and war everywhere, "each man against his neighbor, and winter is coming...such folly, such black mad folly..." Maester Luwin tells Bran to be strong, that he is his father's son. He then asks a boon of Osha, and the wildling woman sends the others away. When she returns, it is decided that Bran will go north in search of the crow with Jojen, Meera, Hodor and Summer, while Osha will take Rickon and Shaggydog south, perhaps to White Harbor. As Bran looks upon Winterfell for perhaps the last time, he thinks to himself, The stone is strong, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. It was not dead, just broken. Like me. I'm not dead either.</p>
