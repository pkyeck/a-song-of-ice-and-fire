			<p><i>Summary by: Vincent Briscuso</i></p>
		</div>
<h2>Prologue (Point-of-View: Will)</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Gared* (ranger of the Night's Watch; beheaded by Lord Eddard Stark for desertion);</p>
<p>Ser Waymar Royce* (youngest son of Bronze Yohn Royce, ranger of the Night's Watch; slain by the Others);</p>
<p>Will* (a tracker of the Night's Watch; killed by the corpse of Ser Waymar Royce).</p>
<p>Ser Waymar Royce is adamant about discovering whether the Wildlings in the village are truly dead. Will and Gared, long members of the Night's Watch are against this, feeling something is awry in the woods north of the Wall. When they discover the Wildlings' bodies missing, Will senses something wrong, but Ser Waymar wants to investigate. The Others surround Ser Waymar, bringing an intense cold with them. Their armor seemed to change color, and no human metal went into forging their blue-shimmering blades. Ser Waymar is killed and the Others depart, but when Will comes down from the tree, Waymar's corpse rises and slays Will. Ser Waymar's eyes burned blue.</p>
<h2>Bran (I)  pg 11/13</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Eddard Stark* (Ned, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, later Hand of the King, once a ward of Lord Jon Arryn, owned the Valyrian greatsword 'Ice'; beheaded for treason by Ser Ilyn Payne at the command of King Joffrey Baratheon, despite the protests of Queen Cersei and Lord Varys);</p>
<p>Brandon Stark (Bran, middle son of Lord Eddard; a warg with the ability to enter the minds of beasts, currently beyond the Wall with Meera and Jojen Reed, Hodor and Summer seeking the children of the forest);</p>
<p>Robb Stark* (the Young Wolf, heir to Winterfell, later Lord of Winterfell, later The King in the North; shot full of crossbow bolts and then run through by a Bolton soldier during the Red Wedding);</p>
<p>Jon Snow (bastard son of Lord Eddard [?], mocked as "Lord Snow", later a steward and squire of Lord Commander Mormont with the Night's Watch, later possesses the Valyrian bastard sword 'Longclaw', later still Lord Commander of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Theon Greyjoy (only surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, ward of Lord Eddard, later Prince of the Iron Islands and self-styled Prince of Winterfell; currently a
captive of Ramsay Snow; referred to now as Theon Turncloak; younger brother of Asha, nephew of Euron Crow's Eye, Victarion, Aeron Damphair, and Lord Rodrik Harlaw);</p>
<p>Jory Cassel* (Captain of Winterfell's Guard, nephew of Ser Rodrik Cassel; killed by Ser Jaime Lannister's men in the streets of King's Landing);</p>
<p>Hullen* (Master of Horse at Winterfell);</p>
<p>Harwin (Hullen's son, guardsman of Winterfell, later member of the Lightning Lord's brotherhood without banners);</p>
<p>Desmond* (a guard, later part of the Hand's household guard; killed when Lord Eddard is taken into custody for treason);</p>
<p>Grey Wind* (Robb's direwolf; killed by the Freys during the Red Wedding);</p>
<p>Ghost (Jon's direwolf);</p>
<p>Lady* (Sansa's direwolf; slain by Lord Eddard Stark to appease Queen Cersei);</p>
<p>Nymeria (Arya's direwolf, missing);</p>
<p>Summer (Bran's direwolf);</p>
<p>Shaggydog (Rickon's direwolf).</p>
<p>Lord Eddard Stark takes his 3 eldest sons (Bran, Robb, and his bastard Jon Snow) to witness the execution of a deserter of the Night's Watch. Ned executes Gared with his greatsword, Ice, in the name of the King. Robb mentions that the deserter died bravely, but Jon points out that it wasn't courage, the man was already dead of fear. Robb and Jon find a dead female direwolf and her litter of 5 direwolf pups (3 male and 2 female). The direwolf mother was killed by the antlers of a stag. When the others join them, the symbolism is not missed by the adults (the direwolf, sigil of House Stark, killed by a stag, sigil of House Baratheon). Theon points out that a direwolf has not been sighted south of the Wall in 200 years. Jory and the other guards want to kill the pups, but Robb and Bran protest. Jon convinces Ned by stating, "Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord." Ned consents, but warns his children, "And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them." As they are about to depart for Winterfell, Jon finds a sixth direwolf pup, this one an albino and ostracized by the rest of the litter, and keeps the pup for himself.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (I)  pg 18/22</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lady Catelyn Stark** (of House Tully, wife of Eddard, mother of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon; sister of Lysa and Edmure; murdered during the Red Wedding, her throat slit by Black Walder Frey; later restored to life by Lord Beric Dondarrion and referred to as Lady Stoneheart, and also Mother Mercy, The Silent Sister, and The Hangwoman, now the nominal leader of the fragmented Brotherhood without Banners).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Jon Arryn* (former Lord of the Eyrie, Hand of the King, Warden of the East, murdered by his wife and Littlefinger; former Keeper of the Gates of the Moon while his father was Lord of the Eyrie; brother of Ser Ronnel and Lady Alys);</p>
<p>King Aerys II Targaryen* (last of the Targaryen Kings, the Mad King, King Scab, killed by Ser Jaime Lannister; son of Jaehaerys II, grandson of Aegon V; father of Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys; husband and brother of Queen Rhaella, he was approximately 16 years old when Rhaegar was born).</p>
<p>Legends: Brandon the Builder (ancient King of Winter/King in the North, constructed Winterfell and some say the Wall with the help of the children of the forest).</p>
<p>Catelyn finds her husband atoning in the godswood of Winterfell after executing Gared. She considers the stories told her about the Starks of Winterfell: the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks, and they worship the nameless gods they shared with the vanished Children of the Forest; the Children carved the faces of the old gods in weirwood trees, also called Heart Trees, in the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea. All the weirwoods in the south were cut down a thousand years ago except on the Isle of Faces where the green men watch over them. She also notes the greatsword Ice was forged in ancient Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold. Catelyn brings Ned the news of Lord Jon Arryn's death, and Ned remembers how when King Aerys Targaryen demanded his and his fellow ward Robert Baratheon's head, Jon Arryn had raised his banners in revolt, beginning the war. Catelyn also informs Ned that the King is on his way to Winterfell.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (I)  pg 23/28</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Princess Daenerys Targaryen (Called Dany, and later Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt; daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen, later wife of Khal Drogo, later Khaleesi of the Dothraki, and "Mother of Dragons");</p>
<p>Prince Viserys Targaryen* (the Beggar King, second son of Aerys Targaryen, brother of Rhaegar and Daenerys; dies from having molten gold poured over his head by the command of Khal Drogo);</p>
<p>Magister Illyrio Mopatis (magister of Pentos, a wealthy merchant);</p>
<p>Ser Jorah Mormont (former Lord of Bear Island, a knight exiled from the Seven Kingdoms, son of Jeor Mormont, later Commander of Daenerys' Queensguard, later still exiled by Dany);</p>
<p>Khal Drogo* (Khal of the Dothraki, later husband of Daenerys; dies from an infected wound);</p>
<p>Khal Moro (another Khal);</p>
<p>Rhogoro (Khal Moro's son).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Prince Rhaegar Targaryen* (eldest son of King Aerys II Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, brother of Daenerys and Viserys; born right after the Tragedy at Summerhall in the year 259 A.L., the event that claimed the lives of his great-grandfather, Aegon V, and his great-uncle Prince Duncan; killed at the Trident by Lord Robert Baratheon);</p>
<p>Princess Elia Targaryen* (of House Martell, wife of Rhaegar, killed by Ser Gregor Clegane during the sack of King's Landing; sister of Prince Doran Martell and Prince Oberyn);</p>
<p>Ser Willem Darry* (knight who rescued Dany and Viserys from Dragonstone and brought them to Braavos, former master-at-arms of King's Landing);</p>
<p>Princess Rhaenys Targaryen* (daughter of Rhaegar and Elia, slain by Ser Amory Lorch during the sack of King's Landing);</p>
<p>Prince Aegon Targaryen* (infant son of Rhaegar and Elia, slain by Ser Gregor at his mother's breast ).</p>
<p><NOTE: neither Rhaenys nor Aegon are mentioned by name until Daenerys' fifth chapter in ACOK>.</p>
<p>Dany is getting ready for her arranged introduction to Khal Drogo before becoming his bride. Viserys wants nothing more than Khal Drogo's thousands of men to invade the Seven Kingdoms. Magister Illyrio has arranged this betrothal. Dany wonders why Illyrio helps them at all, having heard rumors that he had friends throughout the 9 Free Cities and all the way to Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands of the Jade Sea, yet he didn't have a friend he wouldn't sell if the price were right. Viserys believes Illyrio helps them because he realizes Viserys is the rightful King. Her brother threatens her to look and act her best in front of Khal Drogo. Dany remembers the stories of her brother Rhaegar dying on the Trident at the hands of Robert Baratheon for the woman he loved (the question here is: was the woman his wife Elia or Lyanna Stark?).</p>
<p>Dany was born on Dragonstone nine months after they fled King's Landing. Her mother died in childbirth, her father killed 9 months before by Ser Jaime Lannister, a Kingsguard sworn to protect him. The garrison at Dragonstone had been prepared to sell her and Viserys to the Usurper, but Ser Willem Darry took them to Braavos to escape certain death. They lived poor after Darry's death, begging for a living, until Illyrio took them in. As they approach Khal Drogo's manse, Viserys calculates that all he'll need is ten thousand men, since the Tyrells, Redwynes, Darrys and Greyjoys will all help him when he lands. At the party, Illyrio points out Ser Jorah Mormont, a knight exiled 5 years ago for selling poachers to a Tyroshi slaver rather than giving them over to the Night's Watch. Khal Drogo's braid has never been cut, which among the Dothraki means he has never lost a battle. Illyrio brings Khal Drogo over to meet Dany.</p>
<h2>Eddard (I)  pg 32/39</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Jaime Lannister (the Kingslayer, knight of the Kingsguard and later Lord Commander, knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne; Kingsguard during the reigns of Aerys II, Robert, Joffrey and Tommen; twin of Cersei and brother of Tyrion, son of Lord Tywin);</p>
<p>Sandor Clegane (The Hound, sworn shield of Prince Joffrey, brother of Ser Gregor, later Kingsguard; then presumed dead near the town of Saltpans, however he is most likely the grave digger we see on the island);</p>
<p>Tyrion Lannister (the Imp, Tyrion Halfman, younger dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime, later Hand of the King, then convicted of the murder of his nephew King Joffrey; escaped from King's Landing with the help of his brother and Varys);</p>
<p>King Robert Baratheon* (King of the Seven Kingdoms, The Usurper, former Lord of Storm's End, former ward with Ned Stark of Lord Jon Arryn; fathered several bastards, but no true-born children; his paternal grandmother was a Targaryen Princess [specifically Rhaelle Targaryen, King Aegon V's daughter]; killed by a boar while drunk on wine he was served at the behest of his wife Cersei);</p>
<p>Queen Cersei Lannister (Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, wife of King Robert, sister of Tyrion and twin of Jaime, mother of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen; later Queen Regent to Joffrey and Tommen, until she is taken into custody by the High Septon for incest and other crimes; Lady of Casterly Rock by default as Jaime is a sworn brother of the Kingsguard and Tyrion is wanted for regicide).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Howland Reed (a crannogman, Lord of Greywater Watch, bannerman to Lord Eddard, the only survivor [except for Ned] at the Tower of Joy; father of Meera and Jojen);</p>
<p>Brandon Stark* (older brother of Eddard, betrothed to Catelyn Tully, strangled to death by command of King Aerys Targaryen);</p>
<p>Lyanna Stark* (younger sister of Brandon and Eddard, loved by Robert Baratheon, supposedly raped by Prince Rhaegar, died at the Tower of Joy in the mountains of Dorne);</p>
<p>Lord Rickard Stark* (former Lord of Winterfell, father of Brandon, Eddard, Lyanna and Benjen, burned alive by command of King Aerys Targaryen after watching his son Brandon die).</p>
<p>Ned watches as the King's party enters Winterfell. He notes the weight Robert Baratheon has put on, having not seen him in nine years since Balon Greyjoy's rebellion. Robert asks to be taken to the crypts to pay his respects, even though the Queen protests. Ned realizes that besides the weight gain, drinking and wenching were taking their toll on the King. In the crypts, they pass the ancient Kings of the North and approach the stone likenesses of Lord Rickard, Brandon and Lyanna. Robert loved Lyanna, and seeing her statue, he is bothered that she was not buried in a beautiful place. Eddard states that she was a Stark of Winterfell and belongs in the crypt. Ned tells Robert that her dying wish had been to be returned home. Ned remembers her plea "Promise me, Ned", while she lay dying in a bed of blood and roses, and how the fear had left her face when he gave his word.</p>
<p>He recalls how Howland Reed found him holding Lyanna in his arms, full of grief. Robert tells Ned of Jon Arryn's death, how he had been healthy at the Tourney on Joffrey's name day, but was dead 2 weeks later. Robert talks of Lysa Arryn fleeing King's Landing with her sickly son, and how he had intended to foster the boy with Lord Tywin Lannister. King Robert also mentions that young Robert Arryn will not be Warden of the East. Robert then asks Eddard to be Hand of the King, something Ned wanted nothing to do with. He tells Robert he needs time to consider it. The King also wants to marry Sansa and Joffrey, to unite the great houses of Baratheon and Stark. As they are about to leave the Crypts, Ned is filled with a sense of foreboding.</p>
<h2>Jon (I) pg 41/49</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Rickon Stark (youngest child of Ned and Catelyn; fled south with Osha and Shaggydog after the burning of Winterfell);</p>
<p>Sansa Stark (eldest daughter of Ned and Catelyn, later wife of Tyrion; later incognito as Alayne Stone, the natural daughter of Lord Petyr Baelish);</p>
<p>Arya Stark (daughter of Ned and Catelyn, later a.k.a. Arry then Weasel then Nan then Salty then Cat of the Canals; now a novice of the Many-Faced God at the House of Black and White);</p>
<p>Princess Myrcella (daughter of Cersei and Jaime, later sent to Dorne as ward of Prince Doran Martell, betrothed to Prince Trystane Martell; wounded by Darkstar during Arianne's attempt to have her crowned Queen);</p>
<p>Prince Joffrey* (Joff, heir to the Iron Throne, eldest child of Cersei, later King; died by ingesting wine poisoned by the machinations of the Queen of Thorns and Littlefinger);</p>
<p>Prince Tommen (youngest son of Cersei and Jaime, later succeeds his brother as King);</p>
<p>Benjen Stark (Ben, youngest brother of Brandon, Ned and Lyanna; First Ranger of the Night's Watch, later lost beyond the Wall).</p>
<p>Legends: King Daeron I Targaryen (Targaryen King, the first of his name, called the Young Dragon and the Boy King, conquered Dorne while losing 10,000 men, lost another 50,000 trying to hold it, and died at the age of 18 failing to hold Dorne; elder son of King Aegon III, older brother of King Baelor the Blessed and Daena the Defiant; cousin of King Aegon IV and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight).</p>
<p>Jon Snow watches the procession in the Great Hall of Winterfell, given a place far from the honor table by Catelyn since he is a bastard. Jon was drinking heavily and feeding Ghost under the table, when his uncle Benjen approaches. Benjen tells Jon how they could use boys like him on the Wall. Jon states that he wants to join the Night's Watch, despite Ben's insistence that the Wall is a hard place for a boy, and how Jon has no idea what he must give up to become a member. They start to argue and Jon flees the Great Hall in tears. Outside the castle, he meets Tyrion Lannister who vaults down from a wall like an acrobat. The dwarf advises Jon about being a bastard, "Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength". As Tyrion leaves Jon and reenters the castle, his shadow is cast across the yard, and for a moment, Tyrion Lannister stood as tall as a king.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (II) pg 49/58</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Maester Luwin* (Winterfell's maester, delivered all of Catelyn's children; died during Ramsay Snow's invasion of Winterfell).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Arthur Dayne* (The Sword of the Morning, deadliest of King Aerys' seven Kingsguard, slain by Eddard Stark at the Tower of Joy, possessed the greatsword 'Dawn' [supposedly forged from a fallen star]; uncle of Edric Dayne);</p>
<p>Lady Ashara Dayne* (sister of Edric Stark's father, Ser Arthur Dayne, and Lady Allyria Dayne; aunt of Edric Dayne; supposedly killed herself by leaping off the battlements of Starfall).</p>
<p>Ned and Catelyn are in bed together discussing his appointment as Hand of the King. Catelyn insists that Ned take the position, as it might be seen as opposition by the King. Ned swears that Robert would never harm him or any of his family, but Catelyn insists that Ned knew the man, but did not know the King. Plus, she thought it was a high honor for the King to request Sansa's hand in marriage to his son Joffrey. A knock at the door brings Maester Luwin, who shows them a box left on his table which contained a lens from Myr, but also had a false bottom. Inside was a sealed message for Catelyn's eyes only. The letter was written in code by Lysa Arryn, and contained a warning concerning Lysa's conviction that Jon Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters and the Queen. She burns the letter. Catelyn tells Ned that now even more, he must take the appointment as Hand and learn the truth. Ned notes the parallel of how his father went south to answer the summons of a king, and never returned.</p>
<p>Ned states that he would take Bran, Sansa and Arya south with him. Catelyn doesn't want him to take Bran. Ned had been 8 when his father sent him to foster at the Eyrie, near the same age as Bran, and thus settles the argument. When Jon Snow's name is mentioned, Catelyn wants him gone from Winterfell. She could understand Ned fathering a bastard during the war, and even him seeing to the child's needs, but to take Jon with him to Winterfell and name him "son" rankled Cat like nothing else. She remembers the rumors that the mother was Lady Ashara Dayne, whom Ned met when he returned her brother Ser Arthur Dayne's sword 'Dawn' to her. When Cat confronted him, he frightened her for the only time, telling her, "Never ask me about Jon. He is my blood, and that is all you need to know". Maester Luwin prevents a heated argument, by telling Ned that his brother Benjen wishes to take Jon as a member of the Night's Watch. There is great honor in serving on the Wall, and even a bastard may rise high in the Night's Watch. Ned agrees that Jon should join the black brothers.</p>
<h2>Arya (I)  pg 57/68</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septa Mordane* (tutor to Sansa and Arya; killed when Lord Eddard was arrested for treason);</p>
<p>Ser Rodrik Cassel* (Master-at-Arms of Winterfell, later Castellan of Winterfell, uncle of Jory Cassel; slain by the Bastard of Bolton);</p>
<p>Beth Cassel (Ser Rodrik's young daughter, currently a captive at the Dreadfort);</p>
<p>Jeyne Poole (daughter of Lord Vayon Poole, possibly posing as Arya Stark and betrothed to Ramsay Bolton);</p>
<p>Lew*, Donnis* (Winterfell men-at-arms [?]).</p>
<p>Arya's needlework is terrible, and embarrasses both Septa Mordane and Sansa in front of Princess Myrcella. Arya runs away in anger, and finds Jon on a parapet watching the sparring in the yard. Jon and Arya resemble Lord Eddard, while the other children all have the hair and coloring of the Tullys. Bran and Prince Tommen finish sparring, and then Prince Joffrey challenges Robb to a fight with real steel swords. Ser Rodrik will not permit it, drawing criticism from the Hound, whose face was terribly burned in a fire. Joff mocks Robb, and Theon has to hold Robb back from going after Joff.</p>
<h2>Bran (II)  pg 64/76</h2>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Gerold Hightower* (The White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the reign of King Jaehaerys II and King Aerys II, slain at the Tower of Joy).</p>
<p>Legends: Serwyn of the Mirror Shield (heroic Kingsguard of yore, saved a Targaryen princess from Giants);</p>
<p>Prince Aemon Targaryen (Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, kingsguard as well as Lord Commander over 100 years ago, younger son of King Viserys II, brother of King Aegon IV Targaryen, champion and brother of Queen Naerys, possible father of King Daeron II, bore the Valyrian sword 'Dark Sister' which once belonged to Aegon the Dragon's sister/wife Visenya; cousin of King Daeron I and King Baelor I; died defending his brother Aegon IV from an assassination attempt by Ser Terrence Toyne's brothers);</p>
<p>Queen Naerys Targaryen (wife of King Aegon IV Targaryen, sister of both her husband and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, some say lover of Prince Aemon, mother of King Daeron II);</p>
<p>Ser Ryam Redwyne (another legendary Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, also Hand of the King);</p>
<p>Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk (twin Kingsguard who died on each others' swords during the war known as the "Dance of the Dragons", when Princess Rhaenyra contested her brother Aegon II Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne some 200 years ago).</p>
<p>Bran dreams of being a Kingsguard one day, after being left behind when his father and older brothers accompanied the King's party on a hunt. Bran loved to climb the walls of the castle, especially the older First Keep and feed the crows that nested there. He decided to climb the wall, but his direwolf, as yet unnamed, kept howling at him. Finally Bran was able to climb away. He came upon a conversation while climbing near the broken tower of the First Keep. We find out it is Jaime and Cersei. Cersei is saying that Jaime should be the Hand of the King. She fears Eddard Stark because Robert will listen to him, and that puts the Lannisters in danger, according to Cersei. Jaime makes light of the conversation, jesting that Robert could have named Littlefinger Hand, but says "Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and I'll sleep easier at night". Cersei fears Ned intends to move against them, that's why he accepted the position. Cersei seems to state that if Robert Arryn had been taken to foster at Casterly Rock, his life would be hostage to Lysa Arryn's silence. Jaime claims that Lysa has no proof. Cersei fears what Eddard might do if Joffrey takes the throne, although she thinks they'll all be safer when that comes to pass. Bran finally gets a peek in the room, and sees Jaime and his sister Queen Cersei having sex. He slips and is clinging to the window for dear life when Cersei discovers him. Jaime shoves him off the window, saying, "The things I do for love."</p>
<h2>Tyrion (I)  pg 72/86</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septon Chayle* (priest and librarian of Winterfell; killed when Theon Greyjoy overthrows Winterfell).</p>
<p>Tyrion is reading as dawn approaches. He hears Bran's direwolf howling as the boy lies dying. Tyrion meets Sandor Clegane and Prince Joffrey in the yard. He tells Joff that he should go pay his respects to Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn, and that his absence has been noted. Joff laughs at this, and Tyrion slaps his nephew twice across the face and forces him to present himself to Bran's parents. Tyrion joins Cersei and Jaime at breakfast. Prince Tommen is hopeful Bran will live, and Tyrion notes his younger nephew's difference in disposition to his older brother Joff (Myrcella as well is noted as sweet like Tommen, where Joff is a monster). Tyrion mentions that Maester Luwin believes Bran will live, and he catches a glance between Cersei and Jaime at this news. Tyrion states his wish to go with Benjen Stark and see the Wall. After Cersei leaves, Tyrion remarks that he hopes Bran wakes, because he would be most interested in hearing what the boy has to say. Jaime asks him whose side he's on, and Tyrion says with a smile, "You know how much I love my family."</p>
<h2>Jon (II)  pg 77/93</h2>
<p>Jon goes to visit Bran on his sickbed, but Catelyn orders him to leave. Cat's hatred for Jon is immense, but Jon stays long enough to pray for Bran and cry. As he is leaving, Catelyn tells him that it should have been he who fell. Jon then says his goodbyes to Robb, and then visits Arya. He gives Arya the sword Needle that he had Mikken forge for her. He then leaves to meet his uncle Benjen on the way to the Wall.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (II)  pg 82/99</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Haggo*, Cohollo*, Qotho* (Khal Drogo's bloodriders; slain by Dany's bloodriders and Ser Jorah Mormont when they try to prevent her from entering Mirri Maz Duur's tent);</p>
<p>Irri, Jhiqui (Dothraki slaves, Dany's handmaidens);</p>
<p>Doreah* (Lysene slave, also one of Dany's handmaidens; dies from exposure during the Khalasar's trek through the red lands).</p>
<p>Just before Dany's wedding to Khal Drogo, she dreams of Viserys turning into a dragon. During the wedding, she receives a great many gifts, the most important the 3 dragon eggs given to her by Magister Illyrio. One egg was deep green with bronze flecks, another was cream colored with gold streaks, and the last black with scarlet ripples. Drogo gives her a beautiful white mare, which Dany rides. After the wedding, Drogo treats her gently and Dany's fear eases and she allows him to touch her.</p>
<h2>Eddard (II)  pg 91/109</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Alyn* (guardsman at Winterfell, later one of the Hand's household guard, later part of Lord Beric Dondarrion's party; killed when Ser Gregor Clegane's men spring their trap on Dondarrion's group);</p>
<p>Ser Boros Blount (Kingsguard, divested of his white cloak and later restored to the Kingsguard);</p>
<p>Ser Meryn Trant (Kingsguard of King Robert, then King Joffrey and then King Tommen).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Wylla (woman named by Eddard as the mother of Jon Snow, and confirmed by Edric Dayne; wet nurse to both Jon and Edric).</p>
<p>Legends: Baelor the Blessed (Baelor the Beloved, King Baelor I Targaryen, septon and king; younger brother of King Daeron I, son of King Aegon III; prayed for the return of dragons, saved his cousin Prince Aemon from the snake pit in Dorne; once betrothed to his sister Daena Targaryen before ascending to the Iron Throne, after which he annulled the marriage prior to consummating it, and had all his sisters kept "under comfortable confinement" in the Maidenvault; possibly killed by his uncle Viserys II who was Hand at the time, or died from prolonged fasting);</p>
<p>Ned is woken early and told that Robert requested he join him in riding. They are at the Neck, and Ned and Robert pass barrows of the First Men. Robert starts asking Ned about the woman who bore him Jon Snow, having forgotten (or never known?) her name. Ned tells him the woman's name was Wylla, but leaves it at that. The King then shows Ned a letter from Lord Varys that reveals Dany's wedding to Khal Drogo. The source was Ser Jorah Mormont. Robert wants to send men to kill Dany, however Ned says that the slaughter of innocents is not honorable; but the King's hatred of Targaryens was legendary, and he retorts by asking Ned, "how many times did Rhaegar rape Lyanna?"</p>
<p>The discussion turns to the naming of a new Warden of the East, and Ned surmises that Jaime Lannister was promised the position. He cautions that that would give one family half the armies of the Kingdom, as the Wardens of both East and West would be Lannisters. Ned remembers the events after the Trident, when he came to King's Landing to find Jaime Lannister sitting upon the Iron Throne. He recalls how Mad King Aerys' last mistake was to let Tywin Lannister's army of 12,000 enter King's Landing  professing loyalty (the Lannisters bidded their time and remained neutral during the war until after the Trident was won). Robert is unmoved.</p>
<h2>Tyrion (II)  pg 99/118</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Yoren* (wandering crow [recruiter] of the Night's Watch; killed by Ser Amory Lorch's men);</p>
<p>Morrec* (one of Tyrion's retainers, a cook and groom).</p>
<p>Legends: Aegon the Dragon (Aegon the Conqueror, first of the Targaryen DragonKings, wed both his sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys; conquered the Seven Kingdoms [except Dorne] and united them; came overseas from the ancient Freehold of Valyria, bore the legendary Valyrian sword 'Blackfyre' which was passed on to all the Targaryen Kings until Aegon IV gave the blade to his bastard son Daemon Blackfyre; father of King Aenys I with Rhaenys, and Maegor I with Visenya);</p>
<p>Balerion (the Black Dread, the largest of Aegon's three Dragons);</p>
<p>Meraxes and Vhaghar (the other two dragons of Aegon ridden by his sisters, all three dragons named for ancient Valyrian gods);</p>
<p>King Loren of the Rock (ancestor of the Lannisters, last King of Casterly Rock, bent the knee to Aegon the Dragon);</p>
<p>King Mern of the Reach (King of the Reach, King Mern IX, last king of House Gardener, killed on the battlefield known as 'The Field of Fire' against Aegon the Dragon).</p>
<p>Tyrion travels north with Benjen and Jon to visit the Wall. They are joined by Yoren with 2 rapers he had procured for the Night's Watch. Tyrion is reading a book about dragons, and thinking of the history of Aegon conquering the Seven Kingdoms. King Loren and King Mern had 55,000 men in their army against maybe a fifth that number in Aegon's army, most freeriders of questionable allegiance. Aegon's army crumbled against the greater numbers, but, for the only time, Aegon unleashed all three of his great Dragons creating the Field of Fire which decimated the enemy, killing King Mern. Jon comes over to talk to Tyrion, and the dwarf explains why he reads so often. Tyrion also tells the truth about what the Night's Watch has become, with most members societal discards like rapers, poachers, thieves and bastards. Jon takes offense, and when Tyrion feels sorry for what he said and reaches out to touch Jon on the shoulder, Ghost smashes the dwarf to the ground. Jon calls the direwolf off. Jon then begins to realize that what Tyrion said of the Night's Watch is true, and Tyrion tells him "Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it". Tyrion Lannister is not one such man, and neither is Jon Snow.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (III)  pg 107/128</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hallis Mollen (former guardsman at Winterfell, later Captain of the Guard, later with Robb's army and then sent to return Ned's bones);</p>
<p>Old Nan* (ancient wet nurse and storyteller, great-grandmother of Hodor; unkown if she is dead).</p>
<p>Maester Luwin tries to persuade Cat to leave Bran's bedside and go over treasury counts, and name new men to posts vacated when Ned went south. Robb comes into the room and tells Luwin that he will make those decisions. Robb tells his mother that Rickon needs her, and that he needs her help running Winterfell. Outside, the direwolves are howling and Robb notices a fire has started in the library. As Robb runs off with the guards to fight the blaze, an assassin enters the room. He is filthy and appears ragged. Catelyn tries to prevent him from killing Bran, but has her palms sliced open by the cutthroat's dagger. Bran's direwolf saves both Cat and Bran, killing the assassin. Catelyn sleeps for four days after Maester Luwin bandages her hands, and she is a changed woman when she awakens, a woman with a purpose. She knows that someone sent the assassin to kill Bran because they feared what he might say if he awoke. Ser Rodrik points out that the dagger was expensive, made of Valyrian steel, and should not have been in the hands of such a pitiful assassin. Cat tells Robb, Theon, Ser Rodrik and Maester Luwin her suspicion that Bran was pushed from that tower. She then informs them that she must go to King's Landing to learn the truth of who sent the assassin. Ser Rodrik is to accompany her.</p>
<h2>Sansa (I)  pg 116/139</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mycah* (a butcher's son and friend of Arya; murdered by the Hound);</p>
<p>Ser Barristan Selmy (Barristan the Bold, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the reign of King Robert, formerly a Kingsguard to King Jaehaerys II and King Aerys II Targaryen; knighted by King Aegon V Targaryen; single-handedly saved King Aerys when he was taken hostage during the Defiance of Duskendale; literally a living legend; pardoned by King Robert, later a.k.a. Arstan Whitebeard and enters Dany's service);</p>
<p>Lord Renly Baratheon* (Lord of Storm's End, younger brother of King Robert and Lord Stannis Baratheon, Master of Laws during the reign of King Robert, later proclaimed King; soon after killed in his pavilion by the dark, shadow-binding arts of Melisandre);</p>
<p>Ser Ilyn Payne (the King's Justice, his house sworn to the Lannisters, once Captain of the household guard when Lord Tywin was Hand of King Aerys II; had his tongue removed by command of Aerys for the slanderous remark that Lord Tywin really ruled the realm; also Chief Gaoler of the dungeons below the Red Keep, part of his duties as the King's Justice).</p>
<p>Legends: Princess Daeryssa (Targaryen [?] Princess saved by Serwyn of the Mirror Shield from the giants);</p>
<p>Ser Morgil (evil slanderer of Queen Naerys who met Prince Aemon the Dragonknight in combat).</p>
<p>Sansa is getting ready to spend the afternoon with the Queen and Princess Myrcella, and goes in search of her sister. Arya wants no part of being with the Queen, so Sansa goes off on her own. When she arrives at the Queen's wheelhouse, she sees a commotion. She is frightened terribly by Ser Ilyn Payne, and Lady even growls at him. She learns Ser Ilyn is mute, because King Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out. She meets and names Ser Barristan and Lord Renly, and then Joffrey takes her for a horseback ride in the forest. Joff drinks too much at a farmstead, and while riding, they come upon Arya and Mycah practicing swordfighting. Joff challenges Mycah in a rage, but is attacked by Arya. Before he can hurt her, Nymeria smashes Joff to the ground and mangles his arm. Arya throws Joff's sword in the river, and runs off with Nymeria. Sansa is horrified by how the day turned from dreamy to a nightmare. Joffrey yells at her in loathing when she tries to comfort him.</p>
<h2>Eddard (III)  pg 128/153</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Vayon Poole* (Steward of Winterfell and later for the Hand; killed when Eddard Stark is taken into custody for treason);</p>
<p>Ser Raymun Darry* (bannerman to the Tullys, fought for the Targaryens during the war and lost 3 brothers at the Trident; slain by Ser Gregor Clegane).</p>
<p>Arya is found by Jory, to Ned's relief, because had the Lannisters' men found her she would surely have been killed. She is taken before the King and Queen, and tells her side of the events. Joffrey then tells his side, lying the whole time. Sansa pretends not to remember what happened, leaving it Joff's word against Arya's. The King indicates that it is settled, but the Queen won't quit so easily. She calls for the hide of a direwolf, and Robert is disgusted, but does nothing to stop her. Since Nymeria has not been found, Cersei decrees that Lady be killed. Ned pleads with Robert, and finally tells him that he should at least have the courage to carry out the sentence himself, but the King just walks off. Ned kills Lady himself. Afterwards, the Hound rides back with Mycah's dead body on his horse.</p>
<h2>Bran (III)  pg 134/160</h2>
<p>Bran, in a coma, is dreaming that he is falling from a great height. A crow flying next to him keeps telling Bran to fly. Bran is afraid at first to look down, but when he does, he sees a great many strange images. He sees his father and sisters, and they were surrounded by shadows. One had the terrible face of a hound, another armored in gold and beautiful, and "over them loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood". Bran also saw the Wall, and looked north. He looked "deep into the heart of winter" and was terrified by what he saw. The crow tells him that is why he must live. Bran finally begins to fly, and then the crow suddenly has three eyes, and starts pecking at Bran's forehead. Bran awakens, and a serving girl runs screaming for Robb. When Robb arrives, overjoyed that his brother is awake, Bran names his direwolf "Summer".</p>
<h2>Catelyn (IV)  pg 139/165</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Moreo Tumitis (Tyroshi sailor, Captain of the Storm Dancer);</p>
<p>Lord Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger, the King's master of coin, once a ward of Lord Hoster Tully, later granted Harrenhal and named Lord Paramount of the Trident; later still marries Lysa Arryn and is named Lord Protector of the Vale of Arryn);</p>
<p>Lord Varys (the Spider, a eunuch, the King's master of whisperers, pardoned by King Robert along with Ser Barristan and Grand Maester Pycelle for remaining loyal to the Targaryens during the war; currently missing and presumed to be with Tyrion);</p>
<p>Ser Aron Santagar* (Dornish Master-at-Arms of King's Landing; murdered in the streets of King's Landing during the riots).</p>
<p>Legends: King Maegor I Targaryen (Maegor the Cruel, 3rd of the Targaryen Kings, son of Aegon the Dragon and his sister Visenya, completed the Red Keep and its fortified inner keep later called Maegor's Holdfast; left no issue; husband of Jeyne Westerling; earned the title "the Cruel" due to his brutal subjugation of the Faith Militant; served as Hand to his half-brother Aenys I);</p>
<p>Visenya Targaryen (sister of Aegon the Conqueror and Rhaenys, mother of Maegor the Cruel [the marriage of her and Aegon did not foster the Targaryen line, as Visenya's son Maegor died without issue], bore the Valyrian blade 'Dark Sister');</p>
<p>Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon and Visenya, mother of King Aenys from whom the entire Targaryen line of Kings descended).</p>
<p>Catelyn and Ser Rodrik arrive at King's Landing and pay the captain of the ship which brought them from White Harbor. When Ser Rodrik cautions Cat that someone may recognize her, she thinks of Littlefinger, and how as a ward of her father, they had been close as children. She remembers Littlefinger challenging Brandon Stark to a duel for her hand in marriage, and Cat had to persuade Brandon not to kill him. Brandon allowed him to yield after scarring him. Cat and Ser Rodrik go to an inn, and then the old knight goes off to find Ser Aron Santagar.</p>
<p>Catelyn is awoken from sleep by knocking at her door. The City Watchmen at the door bear a paper with Littlefinger's seal on it. Catelyn thinks that Captain Moreo must have given away her location. As she approaches the Red Keep, Cat remembers the stories of how its construction was commanded by Aegon the Conqueror, but it was Maegor the Cruel who finished the great keep and had all the builders put to death so that only the Targaryens would know its secrets. She is brought before Littlefinger, and learns that she was found by Lord Varys. Littlefinger wants to know why she is in King's Landing, and offers his help. Varys arrives and unbelievably knows of the dagger Cat is carrying. Cat shows them the dagger, and Littlefinger tells her it was his, although he had lost it betting on Ser Jaime Lannister in the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day, when Ser Loras Tyrell won the joust. He tells Cat he lost it to Tyrion Lannister.</p>
<h2>Jon (III)  pg 148/176</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Alliser Thorne (Master-at-Arms of Castle Black, later Master-at-Arms of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea);</p>
<p>Grenn (Night's Watch recruit, later Ranger);</p>
<p>Jeren (recruit);</p>
<p>Todder (Toad, a recruit, later Ranger);</p>
<p>Dareon* (recruit, former singer, later steward at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, then named a recruiter; slain by Arya Stark in Braavos);</p>
<p>Pypar (Pyp, recruit, later Ranger);</p>
<p>Halder (recruit, later member of the Builders);</p>
<p>Donal Noye* (armorer at Castle Black, once master armorer at Storm's End; killed by Mag the Mighty fighting to hold the gate beneath the Wall);</p>
<p>Lord Jeor Mormont* (Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, the Old Bear, former Lord of Bear Island, father of Ser Jorah Mormont, brother of Lady Maege; murdered by Ollo Lophand in Craster's Keep following the events at the Fist of the First Men).</p>
<p>Jon is training under Ser Alliser Thorne at Castle Black, but keeps beating the other recruits, often injuring them. Ser Alliser mercilessly berates them, calling each by derogatory names. Jon injures Grenn's hand during a spar. Later that day, Grenn, Toad and the two rapers attack Jon in his cell. Jon fights them off until Donal Noye intervenes. Donal Noye had been blacksmith to Lord Stannis, and some say he forged King Robert's warhammer. He lost an arm at the seige of Storm's End, and subsequently took the black. Noye explains to Jon that the other recruits had little to no formal training in swordfighting, whereas Jon was trained by an annointed knight. Jon realizes that what he was doing was wrong. Afterward, he meets Tyrion who calls him Lord Snow like the others. When Jon objects to the title, Tyrion tells him, "If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can't hurt you with it anymore". They go to the mess hall together, and Tyrion mentions that Benjen Stark, who went in search of Ser Waymar Royce, is too long away. Ser Alliser tells Jon that the Lord Commander wants to see him. A message from Winterfell reveals that Bran had awoken. Jon is overjoyed, and when he sees Grenn, he tells him that he'll help him learn how to fight better.</p>
<h2>Eddard (IV)  pg 160/190</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Grand Maester Pycelle (maester of the Citadel, member of the King's small council, pardoned by King Robert; served six kings: Aegon V, Jaeherys II, Aerys II, Robert Baratheon, Joffrey and then Tommen).</p>
<p>Ned has just arrived at King's Landing, and is told that the small council is having an urgent meeting. Ned looks at the members of the small council, and remembers Robert saying how he is surrounded by flatterers and fools, and sees the truth in the statement. A letter sent ahead by the King proclaims that a tourney and feast would be held in honor of Ned's appointment as Hand. Ned wants nothing of it, but has no say. He learns that over the last 14 years, the King and his council have beggared the realm, with the crown in debt some 6 million gold, most of it owed to the Lannisters. Ned cannot believe that Jon Arryn allowed this to happen, but Littlefinger claims it was Robert's extravagance. Ned leaves to return to the Tower of the Hand, but is intercepted by Littlefinger, who takes him on a long journey through the castle and into the city in an effort to mislead anyone who might be watching them.</p>
<p>He takes Ned to a brothel that he owns, where Catelyn and Ser Rodrik await. Ned nearly kills Littlefinger in disbelief until Ser Rodrik appears. Cat tells Ned everything that has transpired, and Ned feels that he should take his case, and the dagger, to the King. Littlefinger tells him there is no proof, and advises that he should throw away the dagger and forget it ever existed. Ned tells him he is as big a fool now as when he took up a sword against Brandon. Petyr is eager to help them find the truth, but Cat is worried about Varys, and how he seems to learn things through sorcery. Littlefinger tells them not to worry about Varys, "I hold the man in the palm of my hand. You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like that." Ned leaves Cat instructions for his bannermen to fortify Moat Cailin and to keep a careful watch over Theon Greyjoy in case his father's fleets are needed, and then takes his leave.</p>
<h2>Tyrion (III)  pg 171/203</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Bowen Marsh (Lord Steward of Castle Black);</p>
<p>Ser Jaremy Rykker* (senior ranger of the Night's Watch; slain by the wights when the corpses of Jafer Flowers and Othor rise);</p>
<p>Maester Aemon* (ancient maester of the Night's Watch, once Aemon Targaryen, older brother of Egg [Aegon V Targaryen], younger brother of Daeron and Aerion Brightflame, son of King Maekar I and grandson of King Daeron II, uncle of Prince Duncan the Small and King Jaehaerys II; dies during the long journey from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to Oldtown at the age of 102).</p>
<p>Tyrion mocks Ser Alliser during dinner at the Lord Commander's table. We learn that both Ser Alliser and Ser Jaremy were forced to take the black by Lord Tywin Lannister when he took over King's Landing (both fought for the Targaryens on the walls of King's Landing). After Thorne leaves in disgust, blind Maester Aemon declares that Tyrion "is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world". It leaves Tyrion speechless for once in his life. Later, Lord Commander Mormont beseeches Tyrion to speak to the King and his lord father about the condition of the Watch. He tells Tyrion that the Watch now totals under a thousand men, and that he has but 3 men to guard each mile of the Wall. Tyrion promises he would: And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. When Tyrion leaves Mormont's chambers, he is taken with a whim to see the Wall one last time. He takes a winch up to the top, and meets Jon. Jon asks Tyrion to help Bran, as Tyrion had helped him. Tyrion promises that he would, and Jon calls him 'friend'.</p>
<h2>Arya (II)  pg 181/215</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Jacks (guardsman of the Hand, later under Hallis Mollen with Robb's army [could there be two Jacks?]);</p>
<p>Tomard* (Fat Tom, another guardsman of the Hand; slain when Lord Eddard is arrested for treason);</p>
<p>Syrio Forel* (a master Water Dancer, once First Sword of the Sealord of Braavos, trains Arya, unknown if he is dead).</p>
<p>Arya leaves the table of the Hand in anger- she wants nothing to do with tourneys and hates being in King's Landing. She runs to her room and bolts herself in, despite Septa Mordane's pleas. Ned comes to her, and discovers Needle. She won't tell him that Jon gave it to her. Her father pleads with her to stop quarreling with her sister. Ned tells her she resembles Lyanna, although Arya doesn't believe him because she had heard her aunt was beautiful. He tells her Lyanna would have carried a sword, if his lord father had permitted it. Lyanna had the 'wolf-blood', like Arya. We learn that Arya and Jory had to drive Nymeria off by throwing rocks at her. Ned feels that Arya should be trained in the use of a sword. The next day, Syrio Forel begins to train Arya in the ways of being a Water Dancer, the fighting style of the First Sword of Braavos.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (III)  pg 190/226</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Jhogo (warrior of the Khaleesi's khas, the Whip, later bloodrider).</p>
<p>The khalasar is entering the Dothraki Sea (a great grassland). Dany is learning how to ride and adapt to the culture of the Dothraki. The heat is a difficult struggle to endure, but one night Dany dreams of being washed in dragonfire, and the next day her pain recedes. She goes off on her own to walk in the grass, but Viserys is raging over her giving him commands. He threatens her that she will wake the dragon, and attempts to grab her. Dany shoves him to the ground, and then Jhogo's whip lashes around his neck. Humiliated, and told to walk behind the khalasar, Viserys tells Ser Jorah to hit Dany. Ser Jorah bows before the Khaleesi, further humiliating Viserys. Afterward, she asks Jorah if she had woke the dragon. Ser Jorah tells her that her brother Rhaegar was the last Dragon, and that Viserys is just a shadow of a snake. Dany later notices that the sun had warmed her dragon eggs. She speaks to her handmaidens, who talk of how magic died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer (presumably the Seven Kingdoms). That night, she brings Drogo outside. The chapter ends, presumably weeks later, with Jhiqui noting that Dany is pregnant. It is her fourteenth name day.</p>
<h2>Bran (IV)  pg 200/237</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hodor (a simpleminded stableboy who only says the word 'Hodor'; real name is Walder, related to Old Nan).</p>
<p>Bran is watching Rickon play with the wolves from his window. Old Nan is trying to tell Bran a story, but he is upset by his inability to walk. When Nan starts to tell Bran a story about the Others, he listens intently. Thousands of years ago, a winter fell like no other, and there came a night that lasted a generation. The Others came during that winter, and they hated fire, iron and the touch of the sun. This was before the Andals had come, and before the women of Rhoyne, when the First Men lived in the lands they had taken from the children of the forest. The Others had slaughtered many, and couldn't be stopped, so the last hero of the First Men set out to find the children. He left with his sword, a dog, his horse and 12 companions. When only he was left, in despair of ever finding the Children, the Others closed in.</p>
<p>But Old Nan's story is interrupted by Maester Luwin. Bran's presence is needed in the Great Hall to greet Tyrion Lannister, down from the Wall. Robb is hostile to Tyrion, but the dwarf has drawn up plans for a saddle for Bran, true to his word to Jon. While they are examining the sketch, the boys' three direwolves enter and start growling at Tyrion. Theon says "The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister". The wolves assault Tyrion, but are called off in time by the boys. Tyrion declines Robb and Maester Luwin's invitation to stay at Winterfell. That evening, Robb and Bran host Yoren for dinner, and the black brother brings dire tidings of Benjen Stark. He says that Benjen is probably dead. Bran believes that Uncle Benjen will be saved by the children of the forest. Maester Luwin tells him the children are dead for thousands of years, but Yoren disagrees, saying that in the north, beyond the Wall, who's to say what lives?</p>
<h2>Eddard (V)  pg 210/250</h2>
<p>Ned is speaking with Grand Maester Pycelle in the maester's solar. We learn that Pycelle was a young man forging his maester's chain during the reign of King Maekar, and he mentions the foretold Great Summer, a fabled summer that never ends. Ned discovers that Jon Arryn was melancholy but healthy, and then suddenly became ill. Pycelle sent away Lord Arryn's maester because he felt Maester Colemon didn't understand the older body as well as Pycelle. On his deathbed, Jon Arryn called out Robert's name several times and said "The seed is strong". The only ones in the room were Pycelle, Lysa Arryn and King Robert. When Ned asks Pycelle if poison had killed Jon Arryn, the Grand Maester rebuffs him, asking who would do such a thing? Ned replies that he heard poison was a woman's weapon. Pycelle says poison is the preferred weapon of women, cravens and eunuchs. He tells Ned that Varys was born a slave in Lys, and that Ned shouldn't trust him. On the way out, Ned also learns that the Queen was not in King's Landing when Jon Arryn died, and he asks to borrow the book Jon Arryn was reading just before his death. Later, Littlefinger visits Ned in his solar, telling him that he has a lead for Ned. Lord Baelish reveals the name of Ser Hugh of the Vale, squire to Jon Arryn who was knighted after his Lord died, as well as 3 other servants of Jon Arryn still in King's Landing. Littlefinger shows Ned two spies outside his window, one is Varys', the other is the Queen's. He cautions Ned to send one of his men to question these servants, rather than doing it himself. Petyr departs, telling him that the smartest thing the Hand had done was not trust him.</p>
<h2>Jon (IV)  pg 218/259</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Samwell Tarly (Sam, later teased as Sam the Slayer, once heir to Horn Hill, son of Lord Randyll Tarly but disowned and sent to the Wall, later steward to Maester Aemon, then sent to the Citadel to begin training as a maester);</p>
<p>Rast* (Rat, recruit of the Night's Watch, once a raper);</p>
<p>Albett (Pimple, recruit, later member of the builders).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Dickon Tarly (younger brother of Samwell, now heir to Horn Hill, betrothed to Lord William Mooton's daughter Eleanor).</p>
<p>Jon is helping the other recruits to fight, when Samwell Tarly enters the yard. The boy is fat, and immediately ridiculed by Ser Alliser. After he is fitted with armor, Halder is sent against Sam and hurts him. Thorne, relentless, wants Halder to hit Sam further, but Jon objects. Thorne sends 3 boys against Jon, but Grenn and Pyp come to Jon's aid. Ser Alliser leaves in a fury. Sam admits he is a coward, further exemplifying Tyrion's statement about men denying a hard truth. Later, Jon joins Sam at dinner and walks with him outside. Jon reveals a dream he's been having, of returning to Winterfell, but it is completely empty. And then he has to descend the stairs to the crypt, and it is then that he wakes up. Sam tells of his father, Lord Randyll Tarly, who sent Sam to the Wall and disowned him as heir, passing the title to his younger son Dickon. Jon goes to the other recruits and convinces them not to hurt Sam in the yard. Sam later thanks Jon and calls him his first friend.</p>
<h2>Eddard (VI)  pg 229/272</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Janos Slynt (Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing [also known as the Gold Cloaks], later member of Joffrey's small council and appointed as Lord of Harrenhal, then sent to the Wall by Tyrion);</p>
<p>Varly* (member of the Hand's household guard; slain when Lord Eddard is taken into custody);</p>
<p>Lord Beric Dondarrion*** (Lord of Blackhaven, later sent by Ned to kill Ser Gregor Clegane in the name of the King, later still known as the Lightning Lord, leader of the outlaw brotherhood without banners [or the knights of Hollow Hill]; raised from the dead 6 times by Thoros of Myr, but finally expired for good after raising Lady Catelyn Stark);</p>
<p>Tobho Mott (master armorer in King's Landing);</p>
<p>Gendry (apprentice to Tobho Mott, bastard son of King Robert but ignorant of his heritage, later a runaway with Arya, then joins the Lightning Lord and is knighted by Lord Beric; nicknamed the Bull).</p>
<p>Legends: Lann the Clever (legendary trickster from the Age of Heroes, used his wits to gain Casterly Rock from the Casterlys);</p>
<p>Grand Maester Malleon (author of Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms).</p>
<p>Ned and the small council hear Commander Slynt's plea for more men during the tourney. Ned agrees to hire more men for the City Watch, and donates some of his own household guard. Lord Renly shows Ned a locket with a picture of Margaery Tyrell, and asks him if she resembles Lyanna, but Ned tells him no, to Renly's disappointment. Later, Ned is in his solar looking at the book Jon Arryn had been reading, Grand Maester Malleon's Lineages of the Great Houses. Jory arrives to tell Ned that Littlefinger's leads are not panning out. Ser Hugh was rude, and the others knew little (although one potboy mentioned Jon Arryn was sending his son to foster with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone). The stableboy mentioned Lord Arryn rode a lot with Lord Stannis, and even visited a brothel together, to Ned's incredulity. But Lord Stannis had taken himself to Dragonstone, and could not be reached. Although what could cause Lord Stannis fear, Ned knew not, because the man had held Storm's End during a year-long siege by the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne. Ned and Jory go to visit the master armorer Tobho Mott, who tells Ned that Jon Arryn and Lord Stannis had visited him, but wanted to see the boy, Gendry. Ned immediately sees Gendry's resemblance to the King when he was younger. Ned confronts Mott, and learns that an unknown lord had visited and paid twice the normal apprentice fee for Gendry, and told Mott to remain silent. Ned still doesn't understand how this line of inquiry led to Jon Arryn's murder.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (V)  pg 238/283</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Jason Mallister (Lord of Seagard, bannerman to the Tullys, had slain 3 of Rhaegar's bannermen on the Trident);</p>
<p>Patrek Mallister (son of Lord Jason Mallister, one of Robb's battle companions);</p>
<p>Masha Heddle* (innkeep at the Crossroads);</p>
<p>Marillion* (a bard, later framed by Littlefinger for the murder of Lysa Arryn; sentenced to death by Lord Nestor Royce, but we are never told if the sentence was carried out).</p>
<p>Catelyn and Ser Rodrik enter an inn at the Crossroads on the way back to Winterfell. They are not recognized since they look like road-weary travelers. When they go down to the common room for dinner, they are accosted by the singer Marillion. As they eat, Tyrion arrives with his two men and Yoren. Tyrion would not have noticed Cat had Marillion not jumped up to declare a performance in Tyrion's honor. When Tyrion notices Cat, she decides to play her hand. She asks some of the men in the room if their lords are true to her father, Lord Hoster Tully. The Brackens, Freys and Whents are all represented in the room. She then tells how Tyrion was a guest in her home, and had sent an assassin to kill her son. A dozen men draw swords and help Cat take Tyrion captive.</p>

<p>Ser Emmon Frey (married to Genna of House Lannister, second son of Lord Walder and his first wife, father of Ser Cleos; later named Lord of Riverrun but not Lord Paramount of the Trident; brother of Ser Stevron Frey, Ser Aenys Frey, and Perriane Haigh);</p>
<p>Ser Theo Frey (grandson of Lord Walder [?]);</p>
<p>Ser Perwyn Frey (eldest son of Lord Walder and his sixth wife, brother of Ser Benfrey Frey, Maester Willamen, Olyvar Frey, and Roslin Tully; later battle companion of Robb Stark);</p>
<p>Martyn Rivers (bastard son of Lord Walder Frey);</p>
<p>Jalabhar Xho (exiled prince from the Summer Isles, has been a member of the court in King's Landing for several years);</p>
<p>Lothor Brune (a freerider, later in service to Littlefinger, later knighted and nicknamed Apple-Eater; currently Captain of the Guards at the Eyrie);</p>
<p>Ser Hugh of the Vale* (former squire of Jon Arryn, knighted at his Lord's death; killed by Ser Gregor Clegane during the Hand's tourney);</p>
<p>Ser Loras Tyrell (the Knight of Flowers, later Lord Commander of King Renly's Rainbow Guard, later still Kingsguard of Joffrey and Tommen, youngest son of Lord Mace Tyrell);</p>
<p>Moon Boy (a fool and juggler; possibly a spy for Lord Varys).</p>
<p>Sansa watches the tourney from a place of honor with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole. As the jousting progressed, Ser Gregor Clegane's lance rides up and impales Ser Hugh in the neck, killing him. By the end of the day's jousting, the four remaining were Ser Gregor, the Hound, Ser Loras Tyrell and Ser Jaime Lannister. Littlefinger meets Sansa for the first time and mentions how much she looks like her mother, and touches her cheek. Later, at the feast, Joffrey sits next to her and is the soul of courtesy. The King gets drunk and then starts screaming at the Queen that he will fight in the melee on the morrow. The Queen leaves with a cold look on her face. Joffrey then tells the Hound to take Sansa back to her quarters, and deserts her. Sandor confronts Sansa when she calls him Ser, telling her he is no knight, and spits on their vows. Drunk, the Hound tells her that Gregor killed Ser Hugh on purpose during the tourney. As he continues to get riled up and forces her to look upon his face, he tells her how Ser Gregor had burned his face as a child, and then threatens to kill her if she ever mentions the story to anyone.</p>
<h2>Eddard (VII)  pg 256/305</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lancel Lannister (eldest son of Ser Kevan Lannister, brother of Willem and Martyn; squire to King Robert, later knighted; later still named Lord and given the lands of House Darry, but forsakes the title and his wife in order to take vows as a Warrior's Son- the newly reformed militant branch of the Faith);</p>
<p>Anguy (a commoner from the Dornish Marches, later called Archer, member of the brotherhood without banners).</p>
<p>Eddard and Ser Barristan see that Ser Hugh is taken by the silent sisters. When they come upon the King's pavilion, they hear him raging at his two squires, both Lannisters. His armor won't fit and he calls for Ser Aron Santagar. Ned tries to dissuade him from entering the melee, but Robert won't listen, until Ser Barristan tells him that no man would dare to strike him during the melee. This makes Robert reconsider. We learn that Jon Arryn had recommended the marriage between Robert and Cersei. Robert tells Ned that he was sure Joffrey lied regarding the incident with Arya, saying, "How could I have made a son like that?" The King mentions that Renly has told him about Ser Loras' sister Margaery, as Robert is tired of Cersei. At the tourney later, Sandor defeats Ser Jaime, and then Ser Gregor faces Ser Loras. Loras' mare is in heat, and Ser Gregor cannot control his horse, allowing Ser Loras to unseat him. Gregor gets up in a rage, slays his horse, and then comes at Ser Loras. The Hound prevents his brother from killing Ser Loras, and Gregor begins to slash at his brother. Ned notes that while Gregor swings at the Hound's head, Sandor never actually attacks his brother, only defends himself.</p>
<p>The Kingsguard finally stop the fight. Ser Loras defers the championship to the Hound, who takes the winner's purse. A boy named Anguy wins the archery event, and Thoros of Myr wins the melee. Ned returns to his solar, thinking of what he has learned. He thinks of Robert's bastards and how they might relate to Jon Arryn's death and the attempt on Bran's life. He remembers Edric Storm, a bastard Robert fathered on Stannis' wedding night and was forced to recognize because his mother was highborn. A knock at his door brings a stranger, who turns out to be Varys in disguise. The Spider reveals that the Lannisters had hoped to kill Robert during the melee, telling Ned that Cersei's forbidding Robert from entering the melee was the surest way to get him to swear he would enter! Varys tells Ned that he now trusts him as loyal to the realm, and explains why the Queen fears Ned- because the King will not harm him, not even at Cersei's command. He reveals that the Kingsguard are a paper shield, that Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the Queen's men for sure, the others he is not sure on, and Ser Barristan is too old. When Ned asks Varys how Jon Arryn died, the Spider tells him that the Tears of Lys, a deadly poison, was used. Varys claims it was given to him by his squire, Ser Hugh, who now lies dead. When Eddard asks Varys what Lord Arryn had been doing to bring upon his murder, Varys replies, "Asking questions."</p>
<h2>Tyrion (IV)  pg 272/324</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Chiggen* (a sellsword);</p>
<p>Bronn (sellsword, later Tyrion's right hand man, later knighted as Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, then marries Lollys Stokeworth; currently holds Castle Stokeworth as "Lord");</p>
<p>Jyck* (one of Tyrion's men);</p>
<p>Ser Willis Wode (hedge knight in the service of Lady Shella Whent);</p>
<p>Mohor*, Lharys* and Kurleket* (men-at-arms in service of Lord Jonos Bracken).</p>
<p>Tyrion, captive of Lady Catelyn, sees little chance of reaching the Eyrie alive. He was deceived, thinking Cat would take him to Winterfell, but he was blindfolded and found they were on the high road to the Vale of Arryn. Tyrion had tried at the inn to get men to go to his father, but if Lord Tywin sent men in pursuit, they were going the wrong way. As they ride, Catelyn confronts him about sending the killer with his dagger, and Tyrion denies owning the dagger. He mentions how Littlefinger often boasts of having taken Cat's maidenhead, which Catelyn denies. When Tyrion tries to give proof that he didn't own the dagger, they are attacked by clansmen from the Mountains of the Moon. Catelyn agrees to arm Tyrion and his men. They survive the battle, but lose several of their men. Tyrion actually saves Catelyn's life during the fight. Afterward, Tyrion finishes presenting his proof, telling Cat about the flaw in Littlefinger's story- Baelish claimed Tyrion won it by betting on Ser Loras and winning, but Tyrion tells her he lost the bet because he always bets on his brother.</p>
<h2>Arya (III)  pg 284/338</h2>
<p>Arya is chasing an old black tomcat, part of her training with Syrio Forel. She corners the cat and is seen by Prince Tommen and Princess Myrcella, who don't recognize her. She flees, and finds herself in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. She finds the room with the dragon skulls, then comes upon a deep well with a winding staircase. Two men are climbing it, and from their descriptions, it must be Varys (he wears the same disguise when he visits Ned in the dungeon later) and Magister Illyrio. The conversation revolves around what the Hand will do once he finds out the truth. Varys says the wolf and lion will soon be at each others' throats as the Hand is not a man to put aside the attempt on his son's life. Illyrio says it is too soon, "what good is war now?", 'we' need more time. Varys says he can't delay the inevitable unless he were a wizard, to which Illyrio responds that the eunuch is. Illyrio says, "If one Hand can die, why not a second?".</p>
<p>Illyrio remarks that Dany is pregnant, but the Khal will not bestir himself until the child is born. Varys says time is running out, as more players enter the game. Lord Stannis and Lysa Arryn are gathering swords, Ser Loras and Lord Renly intend to try to wed Margaery Tyrell to King Robert (after he discards Cersei). Varys knows not what Littlefinger is up to. But Ned is the one who worries him. He tells Illyrio, "Delay, you say. Make haste, I reply". Varys says he needs another 50 birds, and Illyrio says they are hard to find, "so young, to know their letters", to which Varys responds "the younger are safer". Arya makes her way to the Tower of the Hand, but Ned believes not a word of what she is telling him, about monsters and wizards. Yoren arrives with word of what transpired at the Crossroads with Cat taking Tyrion captive, but he insists it is for Ned's ears only. Arya asks Desmond how many men her father has, and Desmond tells her fifty, but each northman is worth 10 southron swords.</p>
<h2>Eddard (VIII)  pg 294/351</h2>
<p>Ned is trying to persuade Robert against sending men to kill Dany, after they learn of her pregnancy from Varys. Robert wants every Targaryen dead, and gets very angry at Ned's resistance. The other Counselors agree with the King except Ser Barristan, Renly stating that Robert should have had Viserys and Daenerys killed years ago, but he listened to Jon Arryn. Ned points out that at the Trident, Ser Barristan slew a dozen of Robert and Ned's men, yet when Roose Bolton urged them to cut his throat, Robert instead absolved him and he stood Lord Commander and at the table with the small council. Pycelle says that the realm will bleed if Dany brings an army to Westeros, so the murder of one is justified. Renly suggests that Ser Jorah craves a pardon, so use him. But Varys suggests using poison, the Tears of Lys, to which Pycelle seems to awaken from his sleepy look. Ned, disgusted, tells Robert to do it himself, then resigns from office as Hand, and leaves the room, overhearing Pycelle mention the Faceless Men on Braavos, but Littlefinger is appalled because they are so expensive to hire.</p>
<p>Ned gets to the tower, and tells Vayon Poole to make preparations to leave King's Landing and return to Winterfell. He says they must be gone soon, a fortnight is too long. But Ned doesn't want to leave yet with so much undone, especially not discovering why Jon Arryn died. He thinks of sailing to Dragonstone to find out what Stannis knows. But if he learns the truth what then, Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust. Littlefinger arrives as Ned is thinking, and tells him that Robert will offer a lordship and land to anyone who kills Daenerys. Ned makes it known that he is returning to Winterfell, but Littlefinger tells him if he is still in King's Landing come evening, he will take him to the elusive brothel his men have been searching for.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (VI)  pg 301/359</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Donnel Waynwood (knight of the Vale, second son of Lady Anya Waynwood; later succeeds Ser Brynden as Knight of the Gate);</p>
<p>Ser Brynden Tully (the Blackfish, Knight of the Gate, brother of Lord Hoster Tully, uncle of Catelyn and Lysa Arryn, later commander of Robb's outriders, then Castellan of Riverrun);</p>
<p>Lord Nestor Royce (High Steward of the Vale, Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, cousin of Bronze Yohn from a lesser branch of House Royce, his house later raised to hereditary status as Keepers of the Gates);</p>
<p>Mya Stone (a girl in the service of Lord Nestor, bastard daughter of Robert Baratheon [the first he fathered]);</p>
<p>Lady Lysa Arryn* (of House Tully, third wife of Lord Jon Arryn, mother to Robert Arryn, sister of Catelyn Stark and Ser Edmure Tully, niece of Ser Brynden Blackfish; pushed from the Moon Door by Littlefinger, but blamed on Marillion);</p>
<p>Lord Robert Arryn (sickly young boy, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, Jon and Lysa Arryn's son; called Sweetrobin by Sansa);</p>
<p>Ser Vardis Egen* (Captain of the Guard, prior Captain of the Hand's Household Guard; killed by Bronn in single combat);</p>
<p>Maester Colemon (maester and counselor to House Arryn).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Mychel Redfort (youngest son of Lord Horton Redfort, squire to Ser Lyn Corbray; his house descended from the First Men; later knighted and married to Ysilla Royce of Runestone).</p>
<p>Only Catelyn, Tyrion, Ser Rodrik, Bronn, Marillion and Ser Willis Wode made it through the Mountains of the Moon and are being escorted by Ser Donnel Waynwood to the Bloody Gate. Cat notices how Bronn and Tyrion have become friends. They meet Ser Brynden Tully at the Bloody Gate, and he and Cat hug each other. The Blackfish had been close to all the Tully children, including Ser Edmure, and even Petyr Baelish, until he left Riverrun after Lysa and Cat's weddings due to a long feud with his brother, Lord Hoster. Ser Brynden warns her that her sister is unstable, and very afraid. They pass the Bloody Gate, where a dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces during the Age of Heroes. Ser Brynden is troubled by Robert Arryn being Lord of the Eyrie, for he is too weak to sit his father's seat. And Lysa is courting suitors for her hand in marriage, but he believes she intends to rule until Robert comes of age. After passing through a valley surrounded by the mountains, they reach the Gates of the Moon and meet Lord Nestor Royce. Catelyn intends to rest there until morning, but word came down from the Eyrie that her sister demands her to make the trip immediately. Both Cat and Ser Brynden are angered by her sister's demands.</p>
<p>Mya Stone takes Cat up the long trip to the Eyrie, passing the 3 waykeeps: Stone, Snow and Sky. Mya tells Cat about a squire she loves, Mychel Redfort, but Cat knows his family is highborn and will never consent to their son marrying a bastard. After taking mules to reach Sky, Catelyn will continue no further by foot, and is taken up in a basket by winch. Cat is brought to her sister's quarters, and Lysa is polite until Ser Vardis and Maester Colemon depart. Then she yells at her sister for bringing Tyrion to the Eyrie, thus dragging her into Cat's quarrel with the Lannisters. Cat replies that it was Lysa who sent her the letter naming the Lannisters as murdering her husband. Lysa is scared, wants nothing to do with war, and is near insane. When Robert Arryn comes out of his room, holding a doll, Cat thinks to herself 'Jon Arryn's son?', incredulously. The child is scared by what Cat is saying, and Lysa placates him by allowing him to suckle at her breast, even though he is six years old. Lysa feels the child is strong, thinking her husband's statement on his deathbed 'the seed is strong' was referring to his son. Robert Arryn wants to see Tyrion, "the bad man", fly.</p>
<h2>Eddard (IX)  pg 317/378</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Chataya (owner of a brothel in King's Landing, from the Summer Isles);</p>
<p>Heward*, Wyl* (warriors of the Hand's household guard; slain in the streets of King's Landing by command of Ser Jaime Lannister);</p>
<p>Tregar* (Captain of the Lannister guard; killed by Lord Eddard Stark);</p>
<p>Barra* (infant bastard daughter of King Robert and a whore; murdered by Allar Deem acting indirectly on the command of Queen Cersei).</p>
<p>Ned and his men prepare to leave the brothel Littlefinger brought them to, Ned having met the prostitute with Robert's bastard daughter named Barra. The child resembles Robert, especially her nose and hair. Ned vows that she and the child will be well cared for. That was Ned's curse, he always kept his vows. He thought of the promises he'd made Lyanna as she lay dying, and the price he'd paid to keep them. He recalls Lyanna telling him that Robert would never keep to one bed. Ned also thinks of Rhaegar Targaryen for the first time in years, and wonders if the Prince had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not. Ned and Littlefinger talk of Robert's other bastards, including Edric Storm, a boy he fathered and had to recognize because his mother was a Florent, cousin to the Lady Selyse, Lord Stannis' wife. When the boy was born on Dragonstone, Stannis shipped the boy to Renly, and was currently in the care of Renly's Castellan.</p>
<p>As they ride back to the Red Keep in the rain, they are surrounded by Lannister guardsman. Jaime Lannister appears, and Littlefinger reminds the Lannisters that Ned is the Hand of the King. Jaime laughs, saying that Eddard is no longer Hand. He threatens Eddard to draw his sword, that he'll butcher him for having his brother abducted. Littlefinger flees, promising to bring the City Watch. Ned says if he dies, Catelyn will have Tyrion killed. Ser Jaime doesn't want to chance it, and tells his men not to harm Ned, but in order to chasten him, kill his men. Jory Cassel, Wyl and Heward are killed, along with 5 Lannister guardsman, but Ned breaks his leg in a fall. He is found unconscious, cradling Jory's dead body in his arms. He is returned by the Gold Cloaks to the Tower of the Hand, and Grand Maester Pycelle attends to his injury.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (IV)  pg 323/385</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Aggo (warrior of Dany's khas, the Bow, later Bloodrider);</p>
<p>Rakharo (warrior of Dany's khas, the Arakh, later Bloodrider).</p>
<p>The khalasar enters Vaes Dothrak under the Mother of Mountains, passing all the relics of empires fallen to the Dothraki. Ser Jorah considers the chances of the Dothraki taking the Seven Kingdoms, and feels that they are fierce enough. Drogo has 40,000 warriors, the same number of men Rhaegar brought to the Trident. He mentions that the Dothraki have no patience for siegecraft, and if the armies of Westeros stayed behind their castle walls they could hold out forever. Dany asks if Robert Baratheon would be patient, and Jorah responds that the King should have been born Dothraki, that he would take the battle to the enemy. But his lords Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark and Stannis Baratheon were too experienced in warfare to make that blunder. We learn how much Ser Jorah hates Ned. In Vaes Dothrak, no man may carry steel or spill blood. Dany intends to give Viserys gifts of clothes that would make him fit in with the Dothraki, and as an apology for his recent treatment. But Viserys is near insane, and spits upon the gifts, but when he moves to grab her, she hits him in the face with a belt. Viserys leaves in anger.</p>
<h2>Bran (V)  pg 332/396</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Joseth* (former stablehand, later master of horse; killed when Theon overthrows Winterfell);</p>
<p>Osha (a wildling woman, later a servant in Winterfell, later still becomes Rickon's protector);</p>
<p>Hali* (a wildling woman, killed by Grey Wind and Summer);</p>
<p>Quent (Winterfell guardsman, later under Hallis Mollen with Robb's army);</p>
<p>Wallen* (deserter of the Night's Watch; killed by Grey Wind and Summer);</p>
<p>Stiv* (another deserter of the Night's Watch, slain by Theon Greyjoy);</p>
<p>Wayn* (Winterfell guard);</p>
<p>Kyra (serving wench at the Smoking Log in Winterfell, Theon's concubine; later a captive at the Dreadfort).</p>
<p>Robb, Bran, Theon, Maester Luwin and some men ride out into the Wolfswood. Robb tells Bran about the raven last night, which bore a message about the murder of Jory Cassel, and their father breaking his leg in the battle with the Kingslayer's men. Theon wants Robb to call the banners. When they enter the Wolfswood to look for their direwolves, Robb rides off to find them. Six wildlings surround Bran, two women among them. They slash Bran's straps, and he falls to the stream. Osha suggests they take Bran hostage and bring him to Mance Rayder, who would pay well for the blood of Benjen Stark. The direwolves and Robb attack, killing all but Osha and Stiv. Stiv holds a dagger to Bran's throat, and demands that Robb kill the direwolves. Just before Stiv can slit Bran's throat, he is slain by an arrow from the bow of Theon. Robb threatens Theon for playing with Bran's life, since Theon did not have a clear shot. When they question Osha, who calls for mercy, she tells them that two of the men were deserters of the Night's Watch, but the others, including herself, were wildlings. They take Osha captive to question her.</p>
<h2>Tyrion (V)  pg 343/410</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mord (a jailer for the Sky Cells in the Eyrie);</p>
<p>Ser Albar Royce (son and heir of Lord Nestor Royce);</p>
<p>Ser Lyn Corbray (knight of the Vale, younger brother of Lord Lyonel Corbray; owner of the famed Valyrian sword 'Lady Forlorn', once carried by Ser Gwayne Corbray of the Kingsguard; fought against Lord Jon Arryn at the start of Robert's Rebellion, then switched and fought at his side on the Trident);</p>
<p>Lord Eon Hunter* (Lord of Longbow Hall, bannerman to House Arryn, father of Ser Gilwood; reigned as lord for 60 years);</p>
<p>Lady Anya Waynwood (Lady of Ironoaks Castle, bannerlady to House Arryn, later one of the Lords Declarant; mother of Ser Morton and Ser Donnel; fostering Harrold Hardyng at Ironoaks).</p>
<p>Tyrion is in a cell being brutalized by Mord. He remembers how his mouth got him in this jail cell, by countering Lysa Arryn's accusations and mocking the impregnability of the Eyrie. He thinks of a plot to get out, and calls for Mord. Tyrion promises him much gold if Mord would bring a message to Lady Arryn. Tyrion is then brought again before Robert Arryn, his mother, and the court of the Eyrie. Tyrion works around the accusations against him, using his right to a trial by combat. Lysa Arryn chooses Ser Vardis Egen as her champion, and Tyrion's cause, as he had hoped, was taken up by Bronn.</p>
<h2>Eddard (X)  pg 354/424</h2>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Ser Oswell Whent* (Kingsguard of King Aerys, killed at the Tower of Joy);</p>
<p>Martyn Cassel* (Jory's father, Ser Rodrik's brother, close friend of Lord Eddard, died at the Tower of Joy);</p>
<p>Ethan Glover* (Brandon Stark's squire, the only survivor when Brandon went to King's Landing to confront Rhaegar, later slain at the Tower of Joy);</p>
<p>Theo Wull*, Ser Mark Ryswell* (friends and bannerman of Lord Eddard, slain at the Tower of Joy);</p>
<p>Lord William Dustin* (Lord of Barrowton, a friend and bannerman of Ned Stark, killed at the Tower of Joy).</p>
<p>Ned, dreaming from the effects of the milk of the poppy, remembers the events at the Tower of Joy. The three Kingsguard missing at the Trident and the Red Keep were sent by Rhaegar to guard the Tower. These were no ordinary Kingsguard, but Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of Morning and Ser Oswell Whent. There are sad moments here, as these men were legends, but they would not bend the knee and they were sworn to a vow. Ned loses five of his men in vanquishing the legendary Kingsguard. He is awoken while dreaming of making his promise to his dying sister Lyanna at the Tower of Joy. Vayon Poole wakes him to inform him that the King wants to see him. Both Robert and Cersei enter, and the King lets him know he is displeased at Ned's actions. Cersei accuses Ned and his men of returning drunk from a brothel and attacking her brother's men. Ned informs Robert that he was at the brothel to visit the King's bastard daughter. Ned asks the King for his leave to bring back Ser Jaime to face justice (the Kingslayer had fled the city). When Robert tells him enough men died, Ned asks him if that is his notion of justice. The Queen tells Robert, "If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he had spoken to you", but Robert slaps her in the face in anger. Cersei leaves, and Robert, in misery, tells Ned that Rhaegar won. Robert intends to hunt on the morrow, but Eddard tells him that he is departing for Winterfell since he resigned as Hand. Robert reassigns him as Hand, and tells Ned that if he deserts the post again, he will pin the medal on Ser Jaime.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (VII)  pg 360/431</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Morton Waynwood (knight of the Vale, heir of Lady Waynwood, older brother of Ser Donnel).</p>
<p>Legends: Alyssa Arryn (thousands of years ago watched her husband, brothers and all her children die, yet shed not a tear in life; instead, the waterfall that would not reach the Vale was Alyssa's tears in death).</p>
<p>Ser Rodrik informs Catelyn that Ser Jaime is hosting an army at Casterly Rock, and how her brother Ser Edmure had commanded Lords Vance and Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth. Ser Brynden, disgusted by Lysa's behavior, has resigned his post and intends to return to Riverrun, but agrees to accompany Cat to Winterfell. Before the trial of Tyrion, Cat is speaking with Ser Rodrik about the sorry shape Lord Robert is in, and how he needs to be fostered to learn discipline. Maester Colemon, overhearing, tells Cat that Lord Arryn agreed. Robert Arryn was to be fostered at Dragonstone, but Cat tells him he is mistaken, that Robert was to be fostered at Casterly Rock, but the Maester is sure of Jon Arryn's plans to foster the child with Lord Stannis. The trial begins, and Bronn, though lightly armored, kills Ser Vardis Egen because of his speed and superior skills. Tyrion is allowed to leave the Eyrie with his life, but Lysa will provide no escort for him through the Mountains of the Moon...</p>
<h2>Jon (V)  pg 371/444</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Matthar (Matt, recruit of the Night's Watch, later ranger);</p>
<p>Chett* (steward of the Night's Watch, later dog handler; killed when the wights attack the Fist of the First Men);</p>
<p>Three-Finger Hobb (cook of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>Ser Alliser names which boys have been promoted as men of the Night's Watch, including Jon. All the boys promoted are overjoyed, but Jon notices Sam's worried look. Jon realizes that with himself, Pyp, and Grenn gone, no one will protect Sam. Jon decides to visit Maester Aemon despite the late hour. The Maester agrees to listen to him, and Jon persuades him by recalling Maester Luwin's words that civilization needs men of all walks of life and all skills in order to function. Aemon is impressed by Jon's words, and promises to consider passing Sam into service as a steward to help the maester, since Sam is well read.</p>
<h2>Tyrion (VI)  pg 378/452</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Gunthor (son of Gurn, warrior of the Stone Crows);</p>
<p>Shagga (son of Dolf, warrior of the Stone Crows).</p>
<p>Tyrion and Bronn are alone trying to make their way to civilization, but they must make it through the Mountains of the Moon alive. Tyrion promises Bronn great reward for helping him, and we learn Tyrion kept his word and paid Mord the gold he had promised. The dwarf tells Bronn the story of a girl he and his brother Jaime rescued, who Tyrion later married. When his father found out, it was revealed the girl was a prostitute his brother bought him for a birthday gift, and Lord Tywin had his men rape her, humiliating Tyrion &lt;See Tyrion chapter VII summary in ACOK, when her name is first revealed&gt;. When Bronn tells him that he would have killed any man who did that to him, Tyrion tells him he may get the chance to do just that to Tywin Lannister. A Lannister always pays his debts. That night, they are surrounded by Stone Crows, a clan from the Mountains of the Moon. When Tyrion offers his weapons and armor, Gunthor asks him if he would pay them with their own coin. The clansmen would take what they wanted from their corpses. But Tyrion once again talks himself out of certain death by offering them thousands of weapons if they help him reach his father, and promises them aid in conquering the Vale of Arryn.</p>
<h2>Eddard (XI)  pg 386/462</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Karyl Vance (later Lord of Wayfarer's Rest, bannerman to the Tullys);</p>
<p>Ser Marq Piper (a knight sworn to Riverrun; son and heir of Lord Clement Piper);</p>
<p>Joss (a brewer);</p>
<p>Ser Arys Oakheart* (Kingsguard of King Robert and later King Joffrey; youngest son of Lady Arwyn Oakheart; later sent as Myrcella's sworn sword, later still falls in love with Princess Arianne Martell dishonoring his vow as a Kingsguard; slain by Captain Areo Hotah when Princess Arianne's plan to crown Myrcella is exposed);</p>
<p>Porther* (guardsman of the Hand; killed defending the Tower of the Hand after Lord Eddard is arrested);</p>
<p>Ser Gladden Wylde*, Lord Lothar Mallery* (men sent by Lord Eddard to accompany Lord Beric Dondarrion; killed by Ser Gregor Clegane's men after they spring their trap on Lord Beric's party).</p>
<p>Three knights sworn to Riverrun come to the King for justice, but with Robert hunting, the Hand sits on the throne to pass judgement. Ser Karyl Vance, Ser Marq Piper and Ser Raymun Darry bring evidence of a Lannister raid on two villages under the protection of Riverrun. The brigands burned the villages, slaughtering near everyone, even the livestock. The knights swear it was Ser Gregor Clegane, and the survivors support this with a description of the man. The knights tell the council that Ser Edmure Tully has dispersed men to guard all the holdfasts in the protection of Riverrun. But Ned thinks to himself this may be exactly what Lord Tywin wants, to bleed off the strength of Riverrun as Edmure scatters his swords. The small council is not sure, but Ned is, and passes judgment against Ser Gregor, stripping him of his knighthood, titles, and lands, and sentences him to death in the name of the King. When Ser Loras Tyrell asks for the honor of slaying Ser Gregor, Ned denies him, saying that the goal was justice, not vengeance. Ned chooses Lord Beric Dondarrion to lead, and commands Thoros of Myr to accompany him, along with 20 men of Winterfell. Varys approaches Ned afterward, telling him he should have sent Ser Loras, as 'a man who is an enemy of the Lannisters would do well to make the Tyrells his friends'. Varys also tells him it was a slight not to send Ser Ilyn Payne since he is the King's Justice, but Ned would not send a Lannister man to kill a Lannister bannerman.</p>
<h2>Sansa (III)  pg 394/472</h2>
<p>Sansa and Jeyne Poole are chatting about Ned not sending the Knight of Flowers after Ser Gregor. Sansa tells Jeyne about Yoren coming before the throne asking for men to man the Wall. No one would volunteer, so Ned gave him his pick of the dungeons. We learn Alyn leads the 20 men from Winterfell in Lord Beric's party. Arya comes in for breakfast, and her and Sansa begin to bicker, with Sansa getting hit by an orange which ruins her dress. Ned visits Sansa and Arya, telling them that they would be sent by ship back to Winterfell. Sansa gets upset, wanting to stay with Joffrey, her Prince Aemon. Ned agrees to send Syrio Forel with Arya, if the Braavosi would consent. When Sansa says she would give Joffrey children with beautiful gold hair, Ned realizes what it was that Jon Arryn had learned. Out of the mouths of babes...</p>
<h2>Eddard (XII)  pg 401/480</h2>
<p>Pycelle informs Ned that Lord Tywin is wroth with him for sending men to bring Ser Gregor to justice. Ned knows Pycelle is the Queen's creature, and doesn't care. Littlefinger pays a visit, and tells Ned that the King continues to hunt, now after a fierce boar. Most of the hunting party returned, including Joff and the Hound. Littlefinger leaves, and Ned calls in Fat Tom, now in command of the Hand's guard with Jory dead and Alyn gone, and asks him to take him to the godswood. There, Ned tells Tom to find the Queen and invite her to join him. When Cersei arrives, Ned reveals that he knows what Jon Arryn died for. We learn that all three children are Ser Jaime's. Cersei admits that Bran had been pushed after he had seen them making love. She tells Ned why she hates Robert, because he had called her 'Lyanna' the first night they made love after being married.</p>
<p>Cersei then offers Ned the chance to remain Hand for Joffrey if he will remain silent, and even comes on to him, touching his leg. When Ned asks her if she made the same offer to Jon Arryn, she slaps him. Ned makes it clear that he intends to tell the King, and warns her to leave King's Landing, maybe take ship to the Free Cities, along with her children, brothers and father to escape Robert's wrath. Cersei laughs at him, and tells him he was a fool not to take the throne for himself 14 years ago when he forced Jaime off the seat. Ned tells her he has made many mistakes in his life, but that was not one of them. Cersei replies that it was a mistake, because, "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."</p>
<h2>Daenerys (V)  pg 409/489</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Khal Ogo* (another Khal of the Dothraki);</p>
<p>Fogo* (khalakka [prince], son of Ogo).</p>
<p>Presented to the dosh khaleen, Dany must eat a raw stallion's heart. When she does so successfully and they have performed a reading, the crones proclaim her unborn son 'The Stallion who mounts the world'. Dany reveals her son will be named Rhaego, to honor her older brother. Ser Jorah tells Dany that Viserys had tried to steal one of her dragon's eggs in order to sell in the market, but the knight stopped him. Wondering where her brother is during the feast, Dany finally sees Viserys enter the hall drunk and carrying a sword. Viserys starts screaming at the indignity of his seating location in the feast hall, and draws his sword on Dany. Forbidden to bare steel in Vaes Dothrak, Khal Drogo has his bloodriders seize Viserys, and then the khal gives the dragon his crown, pouring molten gold over Viserys' head.</p>
<h2>Eddard (XIII)  pg 419/501</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Cayn* (guardsman of the Hand of the King; killed when Lord Eddard is taken into custody for treason);</p>
<p>Ser Preston Greenfield* (Kingsguard of King Robert and later King Joffrey; murdered in the streets of King's Landing during the riots).</p>
<p>The King's steward wakes Ned, telling him the King demands his presence. When Ned reaches Maegor's Holdfast, he finds Kingsguard guarding the bridge, and inside the royal apartments, Robert Baratheon lies dying, gutted by the boar. Robert had called everyone off to try to take the boar himself, but he had drunken a great amount of wine. Robert tells Ned to write his final testament, naming Ned Protector of the Realm and Lord Regent until his heir comes of age. Ned changes that part, but he does not have the heart to tell the King that the children are not his. Outside, Varys asks Ser Barristan who gave Robert all the wine, and the Lord Commander tells them it was the King's squire, Lancel Lannister. As Ned is helped across the bridge by Tomard and Cayn, Lord Renly asks for a moment. Renly tells Ned he has 100 swords to offer him, and if they strike now, they can take the Red Keep, seizing Cersei and the children (in my opinion, this is the turning point in the novel).</p>
<p>Ned denies him, stating Robert is still alive, and he will not shed blood in the castle. Renly leaves, and Ned returns to his Tower, commanding Tomard to take 20 men to guard his daughters on the ship that leaves on the morrow. He also tells Tom to deliver a letter to Lord Stannis, for his eyes only. The letter offers the throne to Stannis as the rightful heir. Ned sends for Littlefinger, telling him he knows the secret that Jon Arryn died for, but Littlefinger obviously knew the secret all along. He tells Petyr that he intends to offer the throne to Stannis, but Baelish tells him he is a fool if he does not bow to Joffrey. Stannis will cause the realm to bleed, as he will seek the heads of Cersei and the children, the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne for the siege of Storm's End, and even Lord Balon Greyjoy for his uprising. Ned reiterates that he will offer the throne to Stannis, as he is honor-bound to do so. Ned asks Littlefinger to secure him the City Watch in order to secure the succession, to which Baelish agrees to pay off the Watch Commander and his men.</p>
<h2>Jon (VI)  pg 430/515</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Septon Celladar (priest of the Seven gods and member of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Clydas (steward of Maester Aemon);</p>
<p>Othell Yarwyck (First Builder of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Dywen (old forester of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>The newly promoted recruits stand in the sept of Castle Black to take their vows as sworn brothers. Jon asks to be brought to the godswood to have the old gods hear his vows, and Sam wants to say his vows there as well. The godswood lies beyond the Wall in the Haunted Forest. When each recruit is named to his new post, Jon is sent to the stewards not the rangers, and sees a smile on Ser Alliser's face. Jon is livid at the slight, even though he is to be steward to the Lord Commander himself. Sam quiets him by telling him it means the Old Bear probably intends to groom him to succeed him. Bowen Marsh leads Jon and Sam to the godswood along with a guard of rangers as well as Ghost. The godswood in the Haunted Forest is ancient and composed of nine weirwoods. After Jon and Sam say their vows, Ghost returns as dusk is falling, his red eyes and white face eerily like the faces carved in the weirwoods. Ghost has a human hand in his mouth.</p>
<h2>Eddard (XIV)  pg 437/523</h2>
<p>Ned has convened the small council right after hearing that King Robert had died. He learns to his dismay that Lord Renly has left the city, along with Ser Loras and all their retainers. Ned had counted on Renly's support. He has Ser Barristan read the King's writ naming Ned Protector of the Realm, but the King's steward arrives telling them that King Joffrey and the Queen command their presence in the throne room. Ned knew Cersei would strike, but not so fast. The small council arrives before the throne, and Ned has Varys deliver the King's writ to Cersei. The Queen tears it up, saying the realm has a new King now. She tells Ned to bend the knee before Joffrey and he'll be allowed to return to Winterfell. Ned then states that Joffrey has no right to the throne and that Stannis is the true heir. When swords are drawn, Ned tells Janos Slynt to have his Gold Cloaks take the Queen and her children into custody. But the City Watch turn on Ned's men, killing them. Littlefinger takes the dagger from Ned's belt and holds it to his throat, telling him, "I did warn you not to trust me, you know."</p>
<h2>Arya (IV)  pg 443/530</h2>
<p>Arya is training with Syrio Forel before they are due to board ship for Winterfell. Syrio tells her the story of how he became the first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, by being able to see the truth. As they are talking, 5 Lannister guardsmen and Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard barge in, saying her father wants to see her. Arya and Syrio know that her father would never send Lannister men, and they begin to close on her. Syrio, armed only with a wooden practice sword, kills all 5 Lannister guards, but is then confronted by Ser Meryn, armored head to toe. Syrio tells Arya to run, but when she tells him to escape with her, Syrio replies, "The first sword of Braavos does not run". Arya retreats, but when she gets near the doors to the Tower of the Hand, she hears fighting and sees dead bodies at the door. She runs for the stables, finding Fat Tom dead, and sees her chest on the floor. She retrieves Needle, and has to use it on a stablehand who discovers her, killing someone for the first time. Arya enters the dungeons beneath the Red Keep, seeking a way out into the city.</p>
<h2>Sansa (IV)  pg 453/542</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Mandon Moore* (Kingsguard of King Robert and later King Joffrey; killed by Podrick Payne during the Battle of the Blackwater).</p>
<p>Sansa is locked within a room with Jeyne Poole who is crying hysterically. They hear bells tolling from the Great Sept of Baelor proclaiming the King's death. Ser Boros Blount came for her on the third day and brought her before the Queen and small council. The Queen is angered when she finds out that Sansa was placed in a room with Jeyne Poole, and orders Ser Boros to bring Jeyne to a place Littlefinger designates as safe. Even Sansa is not blind enough to realize from this conversation that Vayon Poole is dead. The Queen tells Sansa that she and Joffrey love her, but then informs her that her father is a traitor. Sansa denies it, but eventually relents and agrees to write letters to her brothers, mother, aunt and grandfather that the Queen dictates. The letters are to substantiate Ned's guilt and to request the recipients come to King's Landing to bend the knee before Joffrey. We learn that Sansa had gone to the Queen several days before to tell her that her father intended to send her back home. Sansa writes the letters, and the Queen reaffirms that Sansa will marry Joffrey.</p>
<h2>Jon (VII)  pg 462/552</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Hake (steward and cook of the Night's Watch);</p>
<p>Ketter (ranger of the Watch);</p>
<p>Bass (kennelmaster of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Othor*, Jafer Flowers* (rangers, accompanied Benjen Stark beyond the wall; later arise as wights).</p>
<p>Lord Commander Mormont leads a detachment of rangers, along with hunting dogs, Jon, Sam and Ghost. They find the corpses of Othor and Jafer Flowers in the woods, two of the rangers who had accompanied Benjen Stark. The hounds and horses will not go near the corpses, no matter what. Ser Jaremy believes they were killed by wildlings , but no one voices the fact that it might be the Others. No one wanted to believe that, for the Others were gone 8000 years, if they ever existed at all. Ben Stark has been missing half a year, yet Ser Jaremy thinks the corpses are only a day old. Sam disagrees, and shows them that the blood in the corpses' veins is dry and crusty, as if they were dead for a long time. However, there is no corpse stink, and no pools of blood were found, indicating the bodies may have been moved. They also weren't decomposing.</p>
<p>Dywen then points out the corpses have blue eyes, which neither man had in life. "Burn them" someone whispers, but the Old Bear wants them returned to Castle Black so Maester Aemon could examine them. When they return, Mormont finds out from Aemon that Eddard Stark has been imprisoned as a traitor. He tells Jon, who doesn't believe it. Mormont tells him that he will send letters to King's Landing requesting that they allow Ned to take the black. Later, at dinner, Ser Alliser mocks Jon's father, and Jon attacks him with a dagger. The Old Bear has Jon placed in his room with Ghost, and his door guarded as punishment. That night, Ghost is scratching at the door and looking back at Jon. When Jon opens the door, he finds the guard dead, his neck snapped and sword undrawn. He and Ghost race upstairs to Mormont's chambers and find a man in a dark cloak shambling toward the Lord Commander's bedroom door. The man is the corpse Othor, and his eyes burn blue. Ghost and Jon attack the wight, but even after its arm is hacked off, the hand still moves and tries to grab Jon. When Mormont comes out of the room, he sees the corpse ready to strike. Jon grabs Mormont's lantern and sets the drapes on fire. He plunges his right hand into the flame and throws the burning drapes on the corpse, destroying it.</p>
<h2>Bran (VI)  pg 475/568</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Rickard Karstark* (Lord of Karhold, bannerman to the Starks; beheaded by King Robb Stark for treason);</p>
<p>Eddard* and Torrhen* Karstark (sons of Lord Rickard Karstark; slain by Ser Jaime Lannister trying to defend Robb Stark);</p>
<p>Harrion Karstark (youngest son of Lord Rickard, now heir to Karhold, brother of Eddard and Torrhen Karstark; currently being held captive at Maidenpool);</p>
<p>Lord Jon Umber (the Greatjon, Lord of Last Hearth, bannerman to the Starks; in captivity at the Twins);</p>
<p>Lord Roose Bolton (Lord of the Dreadfort, bannerman to the Starks, later named Warden of the North; father of Ramsay Snow);</p>
<p>Mikken* (blacksmith of Winterfell);</p>
<p>Robett Glover (bannerman to the Starks, Lord of Deepwood Motte; husband of Lady Sybelle Glover);</p>
<p>Galbart Glover (bannerman to the Starks, brother of Robett);</p>
<p>Lady Maege Mormont (bannerlady to the Starks, Lady of Bear Island, sister of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, aunt of Ser Jorah);</p>
<p>Lord Medger Cerwyn* (Lord of Cerwyn Castle, bannerman of the Starks, a minor lord sworn to Winterfell, father of Cley Cerwyn; died from wounds sustained at the Battle of the Green Fork of the Trident);</p>
<p>Lord Halys Hornwood* (Lord of Hornwood, bannerman of the Starks, minor lord sworn to Winterfell; husband of Lady Donella, father of Daryn Hornwood and Larence Snow; died in the Riverlands fighting for his liege lord).</p>
<p>Bran and Maester Luwin are watching the last of Lord Eddard's bannermen arrive at Winterfell. The Karstarks are the last to arrive, and they are said to have Stark blood in them, going back hundreds of years. Luwin tells Bran that there are over 12,000 men, but only 300 knights because the North holds to the old gods, and knights are annointed in a sept of the Seven gods. Luwin tells him, "a man's worth is not marked by a Ser before his name." Bran has Hodor take him to the godswood, and he prays for his kin before the heart tree. Osha hears him, as she keeps the old gods as well, and tells him they are answering his prayers by the wind in the leaves. Osha translates that the old gods are sad, and that they cannot help his brother in the South, as the old gods have no power there since all the weirwoods were destroyed thousands of years ago. Hodor comes from the hot springs where he was bathing, and Osha points out that he has giantish blood in him due to his size. When Bran tells her that Maester Luwin taught him that there are no more giants, Osha tells him that the Maester should ride beyond the wall. The giants often breed with men beyond the wall, producing half-breeds. She tells Bran that Robb should be marching his army north beyond the wall, not south.</p>
<p>We learn that Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall, was once a sworn brother of the Night's Watch who came from the Shadow Tower. Bran also recalls when the bannermen first began to arrive, how they tested Robb. When Greatjon Umber demanded right to command, he drew his sword against Robb, but had two fingers torn off by Grey Wind. Since the incident, the Greatjon was Robb's staunchest supporter. Roose Bolton was a man of few words, and according to Old Nan, there is supposedly, still to this day, a room where the men of the Dreadfort hang the skins of their enemies. Bran also knows from his brother that King Robert is dead, and that their lord father has been imprisoned for treason. Later that night, Bran hosts the Karstarks in the Great Hall. He hears them murmuring about his disability, and he tells Maester Luwin that he wants to be a knight. Luwin tells him that some call his order the knights of the mind, and that Bran could forge his maester's chain at the Citadel in Oldtown. Bran insists he wants to learn magic, and how to fly, and tells the maester that the children of the forest could teach him. Maester Luwin rebuffs him again, assuring him that the children are gone for thousands of years. Two days later, Robb and his army leave Winterfell to march south, the wrong way according to Osha.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (VI)  pg 487/583</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Quaro* (warrior of Dany's khas; killed by Khal Drogo's bloodriders);</p>
<p>Byan Votyris (Merchant Captain from the Free Cities).</p>
<p>Khal Drogo tells Dany that he does not intend to have his Khalasar cross the poison sea to invade the Seven Kingdoms. Dany and Ser Jorah go to visit the western market, but the knight seems distracted and mentions that he will check if there are messages from Illyrio with the merchant captain. Dany spots a wine merchant, who discovers her identity and offers her a special cask of wine. Dany is about to try it when Ser Jorah returns and confronts the merchant, who tries to flee. Dany's warriors capture him, and we learn he intended to poison her, probably someone looking to win King Robert's lordship offer. When Drogo learns of the attempt on Dany and their unborn child's life, he promises that his khalasar will sail to Westeros and reclaim the throne for her.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (VIII)  pg 497/595</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Wylis Manderly (eldest son of Lord Wyman Manderly, later captive of Lord Tywin until Jaime has him released back to White Harbor);</p>
<p>Ser Wendel Manderly* (second son of Lord Wyman, brother of Ser Wylis; slain during the Red Wedding);</p>
<p>Ser Helman Tallhart* (bannerman of the Starks, Master of Torrhen's Square; killed trying to take Duskendale).</p>
<p>Catelyn finds her son's army camped near Moat Cailin, an ancient fortress of the First Men which guards the Neck. She tells Robb that she sent Ser Rodrik back to Winterfell to act as Castellan. Robb shows her the letter from Sansa, and both know the words to be Cersei's. Cat learns that Ser Jaime's host is nearing Riverrun and have already killed Lord Vance and sent his force running, while Ser Raymun Darry was killed at the Red Fork by Ser Gregor's men. Robb tells his mother of his plan to lead his mounted force to Riverrun to lift the seige, while his main army of foot soldiers move south to intercept Lord Tywin Lannister as a feint. Robb intends to give the Greatjon command of the foot, but Cat tells him that a man of caution and cold cunning is needed to lead the main force, and Robb realizes that he should put Roose Bolton in command. Robb wants his mother to return to Winterfell, but she intends to go to Riverrun to see her dying father.</p>
<h2>Tyrion (VII)  pg 507/607</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Chella (daughter of Cheyk, warrior woman of the Black Ears);</p>
<p>Conn* (warrior of the Stone Crows; died in Tyrion's vanguard trying to hold the Green Fork from Lord Roose Bolton's infantry);</p>
<p>Ulf* (warrior of the Moon Brothers; died with Conn);</p>
<p>Timett (son of Timett, red hand of the Burned Men);</p>
<p>Ser Flement Brax (knight sworn to Casterly Rock, younger brother and heir of Lord Tytos Brax, son of the late Lord Andros);</p>
<p>Lord Tywin Lannister* (Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, father of Ser Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion, Hand of King Aerys II for nearly 20 years, later Hand of Kings Joffrey and Tommen; eldest brother of Ser Kevan, Lady Genna, Ser Tygett and Gerion; eldest child of Lord Tytos Lannister, husband and cousin of Lady Joanna; wiped out the Tarbecks and the Reynes after ascending to Lord at around the age of 20 following the death of his father; shot in the abdomen with a quarrel fired by his son Tyrion);</p>
<p>Ser Kevan Lannister (brother and right hand of Lord Tywin, father of Lancel, Willem, and Martyn; goodson of Ser Harys Swyft; later master of laws under Kings Joffrey and Tommen, then departs to help Lancel restore Castle Darry).</p>
<p>Tyrion and his warriors from the clans of the Mountains of the Moon come across his father's army, and Tyrion is escorted to his father's pavilion. Lord Tywin tells Tyrion that Ser Edmure Tully was captured by Jaime's army besieging Riverrun. Tywin also lets on that Lord Beric Dondarrion is still harassing his foraging parties. When an outrider informs Lord Tywin that Robb's army is approaching, he convinces Tyrion's clansmen that they will be repaid for helping in the coming battle.</p>
<h2>Sansa (V)  pg 516/618</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Gyles Rosby* (old lord of Rosby, later Lord Treasurer [Cersei's title for master of coin] to King Tommen; dies from some chronic lung disease);</p>
<p>Ser Dontos Hollard* (Ser Dontos the Red, a drunk later made a fool; last member of House Hollard which was attainted for their role in the Defiance of Duskendale; killed by Ser Lothor Brune at the command of Lord Petyr Baelish).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Prince Lewyn Martell* (of Dorne, Kingsguard to King Jaehaerys II and King Aerys II, slain at the Trident by Ser Lyn Corbray; uncle of Prince Doran, Elia and Oberyn).</p>
<p>Sansa attends King Joffrey's first court session, where the herald reads off the names of all the lords and knights who must bend the knee to Joff, most of whom are of course not present and don't intend to give fealty. Sansa is shunned by others who believe her father a traitor to the crown. Cersei and Janos Slynt are named to the King's council, and Slynt is raised to lord and granted Harrenhal as his castle. Next, Cersei has Ser Barristan removed from the Kingsguard, but the knight, before leaving the hall, vows he can still cut down the five Kingsguard present, as they don't even deserve to wear the white cloaks. Ser Jaime is named Lord Commander, and the Hound is given a position with the Kingsguard, the first of the renowned white swords to be elevated to the position even though he is not a knight. Sansa comes forward to beg leniency for her father, and Cersei says that if Ned admits his guilt and swears fealty he will be granted mercy.</p>
<h2>Eddard (XV)  pg 524/628</h2>
<p>Ned has been imprisoned for quite some time, and is starving and feverish from his leg injury. Ned remembers when he was 18 at the tourney at Harrenhal, when Rhaegar won the tourney. Ned remembers 'the moment when all the smiles died', as Rhaegar rode past his own wife and bestowed the queen of beauty's laurel on Lyanna. It was a crown of winter roses. Varys finally comes to Ned in the guise he wore when Arya saw him beneath the Red Keep with Illyrio. Varys tells him that Arya escaped and that Tyrion is no longer a captive of Catelyn's. When Ned tells Varys to slit his throat, the Spider replies that is the last thing he wants. Varys admits he serves the realm and was desperate to keep King Robert alive.</p>
<p>Varys also informs Ned that Lancel gave Robert the wine before he took on the boar, but it was Ned confronting Cersei that doomed Robert. Varys tells Ned that if he bends the knee and admits his guilt, he will be allowed to take the black. Ned considers the thought of going to the Wall and being with Jon Snow, and 'the thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep for words'. Ned asks Varys if he is in league with Littlefinger, but Varys reveals that he feeds Baelish choice whispers so that he thinks Varys is his, just as he allows Cersei to believe he is hers. Varys warns Ned that if he does not admit his guilt to Cersei, his daughter's life is at stake as much as his own.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (IX)  pg 532/638</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Lord Walder Frey (Lord of the Crossing, titled the "Late Lord Frey" by Lord Hoster Tully, countless sons and grandsons; bannerman of the Tully's);</p>
<p>Ser Stevron Frey* (eldest son of Lord Walder and his first wife, heir to the Twins; father of Ser Ryman Frey, Jinglebell, Maegelle Vance, and Walton Frey; grandfather of Edwyn, Black Walder, Petyr Pimple, and Fair Walda; brother of Lord Emmon Frey, Ser Aenys, and Perriane Haigh; slain at Oxcross with Robb Stark's army);</p>
<p>Ryger Rivers (bastard son of Lord Walder).</p>
<p>As Robb's army approaches the Crossing, Cat sees that Lord Walder has sealed off the Twins and has amassed his levies. Some of Robb's men think to storm the Twins, but the wise ones realize it would be near impossible. Catelyn advises that the Freys have held the Crossing for 600 years and have always exacted a toll for passing. She declares that she will treat with her father's bannerman. Cat learns that night from Ser Brynden that Edmure was taken captive, and that Riverrun is now fully besieged. Ser Stevron Frey comes to escort Catelyn to his father, and leaves some of his brothers behind to vouchsafe for Cat's return. Lord Walder is very blunt, and comes up with an excuse for why his men haven't marched to Riverrun to support his liege lord.</p>
<p>When Cat and Lord Walder entreat alone, he reveals that he dislikes Lord Tywin, and Cat is pleased that maybe she can form an alliance with the notoriously late Lord Walder. Lord Walder talks of a tourney he went to not long ago, and offered to foster Robert Arryn at the Twins, but Lord Arryn had told him that he intended to foster his son at Dragonstone. After they haggle over an alliance, Cat returns to Robb and tells him to leave behind a force of four hundred men to maintain Lord Walder's alliance, and Robb gives the command to Ser Helman Tallhart. She also tells Robb the price for the Frey's support and four thousand men: foster 2 sons at Winterfell, take one boy as squire, betroth Arya to Lord Walder's youngest son Elmar, and marry Robb to a daughter of his choosing. Robb consents, and his host crosses.</p>
<h2>Jon (VIII)  pg 544/652</h2>
<p>Lord Commander Mormont gives Jon a sword of Valyrian steel named Longclaw, a bastard sword that has been in the Mormont family for years. The Old Bear had the pommel reworked to look like a wolfshead. Mormont tells Jon that he is sending Ser Alliser to King's Landing with Jafer's hand to warn the new King of the dangers in the north. We learn that Ser Jaremy Rykker was killed by the wights along with 4 other men. Sam tells Jon that Maester Aemon wants to see him, so he visits the ancient maester. Aemon explains to Jon why the sworn brothers do not wed, and it is because love is the bane of honor and duty, and the Night's Watch cannot afford men with divided loyalties. He tells Jon that a day comes in every man's life when he must choose between his vows of duty and his loyalty toward his family. Jon insists that Aemon doesn't know what it feels like to be forced into this situation, but the Maester tells him that his vows have been tested three times. He reveals to Jon that he is actually Aemon Targaryen, son of King Maekar and grandson to King Daeron the Good. And he has kept his vows, and lived with the choice most of his life.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (VII)  pg 555/665</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Mirri Maz Duur* (Lhazareen godswife, a maegi with knowledge of bloodmagic, claims she learned Western healing from Maester Marwyn while in Asshai by the Shadow; burned alive by Daenerys Targaryen);</p>
<p>Mago (a warrior in the khas of Ko Jhaqo).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Jhaqo (former Ko, later takes part of Drogo's khalasar and becomes Khal).</p>
<p>Drogo's khalasar moves through the village of the Lamb Men, or Lhazareen, whom Khal Ogo's army was marauding. Drogo had defeated Khal Ogo and enslaved thousands who would be sold to provide gold for the ships Drogo's khalasar would need to cross the poison sea. Amidst the devastation of the village, Dany finds men raping the Lhazareen women. She has her khas stop them and takes the women as servants. When she orders Ser Jorah to help, he tells her that she is truly Rhaegar's sister. When Dany finds Drogo wounded, Mirri Maz Duur, a healer and godswife of the lamb men, offers to aid him. Drogo's bloodriders mistrust her and name her maegi, but Dany is adamant that she can help. Mirri Maz Duur brings Drogo into the remains of her temple, and wants the bloodriders and Dany to leave while she applies her healing arts, but Dany refuses. The godswife applies a plaster of leaves to the chest wound and tells Drogo not to drink wine nor to remove the poultice. When Dany learns that Mirri is also a midwife, she asks the maegi to help her when she gives birth. Drogo tells her, "You don't ask a slave, you command them."</p>

<p>Lord Tywin tells Tyrion at dinner that he will serve under Ser Gregor's command in the vanguard of the army. Tyrion is less than pleased and leaves the table. He returns to his camp and finds the whore Shae who Bronn found for him at his request. After Tyrion goes to bed with her, he speaks to Bronn and learns the sellsword took her from a knight. Later, Tyrion is awakened by war horns, and is saddled up to take position on the left flank of the van, a position that is sure to suffer large losses. Tyrion's clansmen try to hold the river, and the battle ends with Lord Roose Bolton's host fleeing. Tyrion's arm is injured, and many of his clansmen died, including Conn and Ulf. After the battle, Tyrion learns that his father intentionally put him in the van. As they are talking, Ser Addam Marbrand arrives battered and informs them that they captured Lord Cerwyn, Ser Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark and 4 Freys. Lord Hornwood is dead. But he has bad news as well- that Robb Stark led all his horse to Riverrun in an unexpected feint.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (X)  pg 580/694</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Olyvar Frey (fourth son of Lord Walder and his sixth wife, Robb's squire; brother of Ser Perwyn, Ser Benfrey, Maester Willamen, and Roslin Frey).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Daryn Hornwood* (only trueborn son of Lord Halys Hornwood; slain by Ser Jaime Lannister during the battle of the Whispering Wood).</p>
<p>Catelyn, surrounded by guards, waits in the woods near the walls of Riverrun as Robb's host descends upon Ser Jaime's army. Ser Brynden knew the Kingslayer was impatient and would never use outriders, so he was ignorant of Robb's planned assault. Robb's men, with some help from Lord Blackwood leading a sortie from Riverrun, defeat Jaime's host, taking captive the Kingslayer, three of his cousins, and numerous lords and knights. Ser Jaime slew Daryn Hornwood and Torrhen and Eddard Karstark though. Despite the great victory, Cat is unsettled because Lord Tywin is still in the field with a great host at the Trident.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (VIII)     pg 587/702</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Eroeh* (Lhazareen slave girl of Dany's; killed when Khal Drogo's khalasar fractures after his death).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Pono (former Ko, later takes part of Drogo's khalasar and becomes Khal).</p>
<p>Khal Drogo, near catatonic from an infection on his chest, falls from his saddle. 'A Khal who cannot ride is no khal', it is said amongst the Dothraki. Dany takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur. She tells the godswife that Drogo had not followed her suggestions and had the poultice removed because it itched. Mirri informs Dany that the Khal is beyond help. When Dany pleads with her to do something, Drogo's bloodriders will not hear of it and want the lamb woman dead. Mirri tells Daenerys that there is a spell that she paid dearly to learn from a bloodmage in Asshai, but that death was cleaner. Dany will not hear of it, and even when Mirri warns her that only death can pay for life, Dany is oblivious and commands her to use the spell on Drogo. They lead in the khal's horse and slit its throat, and then Mirri bids them all to leave the tent. Outside, Drogo's bloodriders come to put an end to this madness. Dany's khas and Jorah defeat the 3 bloodriders, losing Quaro in the fight and Jorah is injured badly. As the fight is occurring, Dany starts to go into labor. Her handmaids remember that Mirri is also a midwife, and despite Dany's protest and the frightening shadows dancing in the tent with Mirri, Jorah brings Dany across the threshold. No living man must look on them, was Mirri Maz Duur's warning to Dany about the dead that would dance in the tent during the spellcasting.</p>
<h2>Arya (V)  pg 599/716</h2>
<p>Arya is living off pigeons in the alleys of Flea Bottom. Seeking a way out of the city, she is swept along by the crowd to the Great Sept of Baelor where her father will be judged before the gods. Ned proclaims his guilt, and swears fealty to Joffrey, but the King calls for Lord Stark's head anyway. Both Varys and the Queen are stunned by his decision, but as quick as it was said Lord Slynt shoved Eddard down and Ser Ilyn, wielding Ice, beheaded him. Arya does not see the sword blow, as she is caught by Yoren who takes her into a back alley. He cuts her hair and warns her to pretend she is a boy.</p>
<h2>Bran (VII)  pg 610/729</h2>
<p>Legends: Symeon Star-Eyes (legendary knight who lost his eyesight and put star sapphires in his eye sockets);</p>
<p>Jon Stark (ancient King of Winter who defeated the sea raiders and built the castle at White Harbor);</p>
<p>Brandon the Shipwright (ancient King of Winter who sailed west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again);</p>
<p>Brandon the Burner (son of Brandon the Shipwright, burned all his father's ships);</p>
<p>Rodrik Stark (ancient King of Winter who won Bear Island in a wrestling match);</p>
<p>Torrhen Stark (the last King of Winter, the King who Knelt, bowed to Aegon the Conqueror).</p>
<p>Bran is watching Ser Rodrik train young recruits in the yard of Winterfell. Bran tells Maester Luwin that he dreamt of the three-eyed crow again, and it brought him down into the crypts where he spoke to his father. Bran says that his father was sad, because of Jon. Bran tells the maester that Hodor will not carry him down into the crypts. He insists the dream was real and that his father was there. In order to dispel the boy's delusion, Maester Luwin calls for Osha and they descend into the crypts. Summer will not venture past the stairs. As Luwin sweeps his torch by the opening to the crypt that will one day hold Lord Eddard, Shaggydog jumps out and ravages the maester's arm. Then Shaggy and Summer fight as Rickon emerges yelling at them to leave his father alone. Bran learns that Rickon had the same dream as him, and Rickon calls off Shaggy.</p>
<p>They go up to Maester Luwin's turret, where Osha bandages his arm. Luwin explains that dreams are only dreams, but Osha says the children of the forest could teach him a thing or two about dreaming. The Maester says that 'a man who trusts in spells duels with a glass sword'. Luwin takes out several arrowheads made of dragonglass, or obsidian, which the children of the forest forged far below the earth (and Osha again says that the children forge it still). Bran and Rickon each take some arrowheads. Maester Luwin then tells them the tale of the children of the forest: 'The children lived during the Dawn Age, before the coming of men in the land now called the Seven Kingdoms. They lived in the depths of the woods, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Their wise men were called greenseers and carved the faces in the weirwoods to watch over the forest. No one knows how long they reigned or where they came from.' 12,000 years ago, the First Men crossed the broken arm of Dorne before it was broken. The First Men were mounted, tall of stature and wielded bronze weapons.</p>
<p>The First Men chopped down the weirwood trees to build holdfasts, and the children of the forest, enraged, started a war. The greenseers supposedly used dark magic to make the sea rise and break the landmass that is now the broken arm of Dorne. Finally, a truce was called and the leaders of both races met on the island in the God's Eye now known as the Isle of Faces. After the Pact was forged, the green men were formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces. The First Men eventually adopted the old gods worshipped by the Children. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age and began the Age of Heroes. The Pact started 4000 years of friendship between the children and the First Men. While the kingdoms of the First Men endured so did the Pact, all through the Age of Heroes, the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms. But eventually the Andal raiders came with steel and fire, and drove the First Men into the North where they endured for many centuries. The Andals burned most of the weirwoods remaining in the south, slaughtering the Children where they found them. The Children fled north (where Osha swears they still exist beyond the Wall). Luwin's tale is cut off as a raven appears and the 2 direwolves begin howling. The message is that Lord Eddard Stark is dead.</p>
<h2>Sansa (VI)  pg 620/741</h2>
<p>Sansa is in despair in her room in Maegor's Holdfast, reliving the beheading of her father. Eventually, Joffrey arrives telling her to get dressed and attend him. She resists, and he has the Hound get her out of bed. Sandor tells her to do as she's bid, calls her child, and pushes her almost gently toward her wardrobe. Sansa pleads to go home, then tells Joff that she hates him. The King has Ser Meryn slap her, then leaves telling her to attend him later. The Hound tells her to save herself some pain and not resist him. Ser Meryn comes for her later, and she tells him that he is no true knight, but the Kingsguard does not care. Sansa attends the King in the throne room as he dispenses justice, every case with violence or death. Later, he brings her to the wall over the gatehouse where the traitors' heads are mounted on spikes. Joff forces her to look at her father's head and Septa Mordane's. Joff tells her that Robb defeated his uncle Jaime by treachery, and promises her Robb's head as a gift. When Sansa says that maybe Robb will give her Joff's head, the King has Ser Meryn beat her again. As Sansa is lying on her hands and knees she contemplates rushing Joffrey and knocking him off the gatehouse wall to his death. But the Hound interposes himself between her and Joff, and gently wipes the blood off her mouth.</p>
<h2>Daenerys (IX)  pg 628/751</h2>
<p>Dany is having a fever dream about her brother Viserys, and her unborn son Rhaego. In the dream Rhaego was a man grown and had the eyes and hair color of the Targaryens, but the copper skin of the Dothraki, and in the end he disappears in a burst of light. Dany had been asleep for weeks, recovering from her miscarriage. When she awakens, she learns of the fate of her unborn son. She summons Mirri Maz Duur and Ser Jorah, and the maegi tells Dany that her son was monstrous, a demon child, dead for years. When Dany says the child was alive in her womb, Mirri responds that death was in that tent. Ser Jorah insists that there were only shadows in the tent, but Mirri tells him that the grave casts long shadows. They lead her to Khal Drogo, really a zombie now. His khalasar had left, with Ko Pono and Ko Jhaqo now Khals, leaving Dany only some 100 Dothraki all of them either old, sickly or children. The slave girl Eroeh was killed, and Dany avows she will bring vengeance upon the two new Khals. When Dany asks Mirri when Drogo will be himself again, she replies with an impossibility, and Dany knows that Drogo is lost to her. She accuses the maegi of not warning her of the price of the bloodmagic used on Drogo, and Mirri retorts that what the Dothraki did to her temple and her people was wrong. Dany has the maegi bound and dragged off. That night, she suffocates Drogo with her pillow, knowing that he was not really alive.</p>
<h2>Tyrion (IX)  pg 637/762</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Harys Swyft (knight sworn to Casterly Rock, father of Ser Kevan Lannister's wife Dorna; grandfather of Lord Lancel, Willem, and Martyn; later named Hand of King Tommen by Cersei, but soon after demoted to Lord Treasurer to replace Gyles Rosby; currently has governorship of the Seven Kingdoms along with Grand Maester Pycelle, since Queen Cersei is imprisoned and King Tommen is still in his minority).</p>
<p><u>First Mentioned:</u> Lord Andros Brax* (Lord of Hornvale, brother of Ser Rupert, father of the current Lord Tytos Brax and Ser Flement; killed at the battle of the Whispering Wood).</p>
<p>Lord Tywin and his bannermen have just learned that Ser Jaime has been captured. Tyrion listens as the messenger informs them that Lord Brax was killed and all of Jaime's host run off or slaughtered, with a Tyroshi sellsword Jaime employed going over to the Starks after the battle. Most of the bannerman are appalled by what happened, and frightened, stating that they must sue for peace. At that, Tyrion shatters his wine cup against a wall, shouting 'there is their peace', lost when his nephew hacked off Eddard Stark's head. Without Eddard alive, they could not bargain for Ser Jaime in a trade of hostages. Finally, Lord Tywin speaks, saying "they have my son!" and tells his bannermen to leave him, all but Tyrion and Ser Kevan. Tywin agrees with Tyrion that without Eddard they cannot sue for peace with Robb, which would have given them enough time to deal with Renly and Stannis.</p>
<p>Lord Tywin tells them that Varys has heard that Renly has wed Lord Mace Tyrell's daughter Margaery, and is soon to march upon King's Landing with all the might of Highgarden and Storm's End. Lord Tywin informs them his daughter has commanded him to march to King's Landing and defend the city. Tywin has no such plans. He also tells them of Varys' tidings that Stannis is building a fleet, hiring sellswords and has employed a shadowbinder from Asshai. Lord Tywin plans to march on Harrenhal and begin burning the Riverlands again. He informs Tyrion that he is sending him to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King, and clean up the mess Cersei and her fool council created. He rants about the raising of Janos Slynt to lord and granting him Harrenhal, and that the fool will never set foot in the great castle. He is also enraged about the dishonoring of Ser Barristan Selmy, and tells Tyrion that he must control the boy if Cersei cannot. When Tyrion asks his father why he is sending him, Tywin replies, "You are my son." Tyrion knows that his father now has given up Jaime for dead, and hates him for it. Lord Tywin leaves off by warning Tyrion not to take his whore to court with him.</p>
<h2>Jon (IX)  pg 645/772</h2>
<p>Jon has a plan to desert the Night's Watch and join his brother Robb in secrecy. Knowing his life is forfeit if caught, he leaves anyway. Sam is aware, but Jon thinks Sam too meek to tell anyone. As Jon passes Mole's Town, Ghost disappears, apparently to hunt. But when Jon hears voices and realizes they are his friends come looking for him, Ghost gives him away. Jon acts tough, but eventually gives in and they ride hard back to Castle Black in order to get there before dawn. But the next morning, Mormont is aware of what Jon did, and confronts him. Jon thinks his life is forfeit, but the Lord Commander tells him, "if we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole's Town, only ghosts would guard the Wall". Mormont tells Jon that mammoth tracks were found near Eastwatch, and Qhorin Halfhand took a captive who revealed that Mance Rayder is massing his people in some secret stronghold. Mormont goes on to say that he believes Jon and Ghost were meant to be here, because the blood of the First Men is strong in the Starks, and it's said that the First Men built the Wall and remember things otherwise forgotten. Mormont reveals that he plans to march beyond the Wall in force, to find Ben Stark dead or alive and learn what Mance is doing.</p>
<h2>Catelyn (XI)  pg 656/785</h2>
<p><u>Introduced:</u> Ser Edmure Tully (only son of Lord Hoster, later Lord of Riverrun, brother of Catelyn and Lysa, husband of Roslin of house Frey, uncle of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and Robert Arryn; currently dispossessed of Riverrun and a noble prisoner of the Lannisters);</p>
<p>Lord Hoster Tully* (Lord of Riverrun, father of Cat, Lysa and Edmure, elder brother of Ser Brynden; grandfather of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and Robert Arryn; succumbed to old age);</p>
<p>Lord Tytos Blackwood (Lord of Raventree, bannerman to the Tullys);</p>
<p>Lord Jonos Bracken (Lord of Stone Hedge, bannerman to the Tullys).</p>
<p>Cat sails with Robb and his army by boat, and they are cheered by the men on the walls of Riverrun. Cat immediately asks to see her father who is dying. Lord Hoster is proud of his grandson Robb's victories, but Cat tells him it was Ser Brynden's strategy. Lord Hoster agrees to see his estranged brother later (their feud was because Hoster had ordered Ser Brynden to marry, but the Blackfish never would take a bride). Cat finds Robb in the godswood, much as his father would do after battle, with his lords bannermen and even Lord Blackwood. Cat recalls how she and Lysa would kiss Petyr Baelish as kids, and how Petyr would touch them and try to tongue them. Robb informs his mother that they must call a council, and that Lord Renly has proclaimed himself king. The lords argue for a long time, with some wanting to march on Harrenhal, others stating they should depose Joffrey and make Tommen king, and Ser Stevron even declaring they should sue for peace. Catelyn wants an exchange of hostages and a settlement of the war as well. But Robb wants no peace for the Lannisters who killed his father, the only peace they'll get is his sword. Even the Lords Blackwood and Bracken, whose families had been feuding over 100 years, agree to that. The Greatjon surges to his feet and lays his sword at Robb's feet, and the other bannermen follow, both Northmen and Riverlords. And for the first time in 300 years, there is a King in the North!</p>
<h2>Daenerys (X)  pg 667/798</h2>
<p>Dany is planning a funeral pyre for Khal Drogo as is the Dothraki way, but her subjects are wary about her intentions. Mirri Maz Duur tells Dany she is a child, and whatever she plans will not work. Ser Jorah pleads with her to flee, that she need not do what she intends. Dany assures him that she is not planning on sacrificing her life in her husband's pyre. She tells her gathered people that they are her khalasar and she will be their queen. When she asks the 3 warriors of her khas to take oath as her bloodriders, they will not commit and tell her she must be brought to join the dosh khaleen. Ser Jorah takes the oath and becomes the first of her Queensguard. Dany brings her dragon eggs to be placed at Drogo's side, despite Jorah's protests that they could sell the eggs and live wealthy in freedom. Dany has Mirri bound to the funeral pyre and lights it. She tells the maegi what Mirri told her, that only death can pay for life. Jhogo spots the blood red comet for the first time, taken by Dany as a good omen. The maegi screams as the flames engulf her, and soon after Dany walks into the blaze as Jorah and her khas plead with her not to. Dany, for an instant, glimpses Drogo on his horse, and then a cracking sound, like a stone shattering, is heard. As the fire dies, Jorah finds Daenerys alive, unburnt except for her hair, nursing 3 baby dragons. Ser Jorah and her khas swear their oaths before the mother of dragons. And for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.</p>
